    "abstract": "A common enhancement of scatterplots represents points as small multiples, glyphs, or thumbnail images. As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.",

Various metrics for evaluating scatterplots, such as scagnostics, have been devised and applied to scatterplot selection. This paper presents a new scatterplot selection technique that applies multiple metrics. First, the technique calculates the scores of scatterplots with multiple metrics and then constructs a graph by connecting similar scatterplots. Next, it uses a graph coloring algorithm to assign different colors to similar scatterplots. We can extract a set of various scatterplots by selecting them that the specific same color is assigned. This paper introduces a visualization example with a retail dataset containing multidimensional climate and sales values.",

Small-sized factories intend to take full advantage of the data collected by sensors used in their machinery. The ultimate goal is to minimize cost and maximize quality, resulting in an increase in profit. In collaboration with domain experts, we implemented a data visualization tool to enable decision-makers in a plastic factory to improve their production process. We investigate three different aspects: methods for preprocessing multivariate time series data, clustering approaches for the already refined data, and visualization techniques that aid domain experts in gaining insights into the different stages of the production process. Here we present our ongoing results grounded in a human-centered development process. We adopt a formative evaluation approach to continuously upgrade our dashboard design that eventually meets partners’ requirements and follows the best practices within the field.",

    "abstract": "Immersive analytics is a fast growing field that is often applied in virtual reality (VR). VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality.",

Changes in height, color, and area of individual nodes can easily be visualized using animated transitions.

We show how procedural texture patterns can be superimposed to the color mapping and support transitions. To this end, we discuss qualitative properties of each pattern, demonstrate their ability to communicate change direction both with and without animation, and conclude which of the patterns are more likely to increase effectiveness and correctness of the change mapping in 2.5D treemaps.",

    "abstract": "Eye movements are closely related to the cognitive processes and often act as a window to the brain and mind. To facilitate a window to the brain using eye movements, we propose EyeFIX, an interactive visual analytics interface. Our interface currently focuses on processing gaze movements to generate the two most prominent events, fixations, and saccades which are used in a large part of the eye movement literature. Our interface has multiple interactive widgets that allow the users to choose the algorithm and tune its hyper parameters that control how fixations and saccades are generated. It has four major visualizations: (1) A Gaze Plot to showcase the gaze movement of each participant, (2) a Fixation Plot that helps to identify regions of the stimulus which are of interest to a particular participant, (3) a Heat Map to study the denser regions of fixation and regions which the participant frequently visited, and (4) a Timeline Visualization to assist in having a closer look at temporal regions of interest. We design a set of brushing and linking operators that allow users to interactively control all the visualizations to dig deeper in both, the spatial and temporal domains. We demonstrate the applicability of our interface with datasets obtained by human subjects viewing naturalistic stimuli while performing various viewing tasks, including visual exploration, visual search, and prolonged visual fixation.",

    "abstract": "There is recent work in applying concepts from discourse analysis to comics in order to formalise visual content across comics sequences, however much of this work lacks empirical verification. We address this gap by assessing inter-annotator agreement on a preliminary annotation scheme for segmenting areas of comic pages, and assigning referents or classifications to these segmentations. A browser-based annotation tool and inter-annotator agreement measures are introduced. We find high agreement for segmentation tasks, while reference tasks show adequate agreement as well as instructive disagreements showing constraints on reader interpretation.",

    "abstract": "The multivariate Spatio-Temporal data challenges the analysts along the navigation and exploration of the information, using Data Analytics techniques. We present SPLORT, as a user-centered web-based solution for segmented Visual Analytics. The tool involves a “What-Where-When” pyramidal paradigm to drive Spatio-temporal analysis towards the findings of new insights. It features multi-layered coordinated views to help the analyst navigate and explore multivariate data simultaneously. We evaluated this web-based tool, and reported the findings and results, considering users’ performance and perceptions, basing our analysis on their Likert scale (0-5) responses, regarding their experience and the tool's usability, and the sentiment of their feedback, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our findings from the pilot study held, suggest that SPLORT successfully allows the users to visually query, explore and analyze contextless multi-scale attributes within space and time, which quickly drives them to new insights and to support easier decision-making processes. Moreover, the tool's flexibility, due to its multi-layered GUI, supports better and more friendly visual analytics.",

    "abstract": "Comprehending and exploring large and complex data is becoming increasingly important for a diverse population of users in a wide range of application domains. Visualization has proven to be well-suited in supporting this endeavor by tapping into the power of human visual perception. However, non-experts in the field of visual analysis often have difficulties in correctly reading and interpreting information from novel visualization idioms. Visualization onboarding can support novices in learning how to use new digital technologies. Therefore, we developed an interactive step-by-step guide and applied the method to four visualization techniques—a bar chart, a horizon graph, a change matrix, and a parallel coordinates plot. Results using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers show that there is a need for onboarding, especially for more complex visualization techniques. We further investigated the perception and rating of a scrollytelling and a video tutorial for the most unfamiliar visualization—the parallel coordinates plot. A comparison between the three onboarding methods indicates that participants appreciated the easy-to-understand examples, the precise wording of the onboarding messages in a step-by-step manner, and the introduction of interaction concepts by highlighting the most relevant information over all onboarding methods. The video tutorial supported the introduction of unknown interaction techniques best.",

Visualization of such datasets is not an easy task since they are complex and often huge. Immersive Analytics is a powerful approach to support the interactive exploration of such large and complex data. Many recent studies on graph visualization have applied immersive analytics frameworks; however, there have been few studies on immersive analytics for visualization of multidimensional attributes associated with the input graphs. This paper presents a new immersive analytics system that supports the interactive exploration of multidimensional feature values assigned to the nodes of input graphs. The presented system displays ”label-axes” corresponding to the dimensions of feature values, and ”label-edges” that connect label-axes and corresponding to the nodes. The system supports visual linking operations which controls the display of edges that connect a label-axis and nodes of the graph. This paper introduces visualization examples with a graph dataset of Twitter users and reviews by experts on graph data analysis.",

In this paper, we present an approach that combines statistical profiling, clustering and visualization to facilitate this task. We implemented our approach in a tool which is integrated as a plugin into a widely used IDE. First, we introduce our approach with details on the profiling and clustering strategy that produce runtime metrics and clusters of threads for source-code artifacts at different levels of abstraction (class and method) and the entire program. Next, we explain the design of our sparkline visualization which represents the clusters in situ, i.e. embedded in the program text next to the related source-code artifact in the source-code editor. More detailed information is available in separate views that also allow the user to interactively configure thread filters. In a demonstration study we illustrate the usefulness of the tool for understanding and fixing performance and concurrency issues. Finally, we report on first formative results from a small-scale user study.",

    "abstract": "Exploratory search starts with ill-defined goals and involves browsing, learning, and formulating new targets for search. To fluidly support such dynamic search behaviours, we focus on devising interactive visual facets (IVF), visualising information facets to support user comprehension and control of the information space. To do this, we reviewed existing faceted search interfaces and derived two design requirements (DR) that have not been fully addressed to support fluid interactions in exploratory search. We then exemplified the requirements through devising an IVF tool, which coordinates a linear and a categorical facet representing the distribution and summarisation of items, respectively, and providing context for faceted exploration (DR1). To support rapid transitions between search criteria (DR2), the tool introduces a novel design concept of using facets to select items without filtering the item space. Particularly, we propose a filter-swipe technique that enables users to drag a categorical facet value sequentially over linear facet bars to view the items in the intersection of the two facets along with the categorical facet dynamically summarizing the items in the interaction. A user study of 11 participants with realistic email search tasks shows that dynamic suggestions through the timeline navigation can help discover useful suggestions for search; the novel design concept was favoured over using facet values as filters. Based on these practices, we derive IVF design implications for fluid, exploratory searches.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe a visualization tool for representing the dynamics of graph algorithms. Toward this end, we designed a web-based framework which illustrates the dynamics as time-to-space mappings of dynamic graphs. Such static diagrams of dynamic data have the benefit of being able to display longer time spans in one view, hence supporting the observer with comparison tasks. The tool can show details about how an algorithm traverses a graph step-by-step in a static and animated fashion, for graph algorithm exploration as well as educational purposes. The animation together with the time-to-space mapping forms an overview-and-detail approach. By using flight carrier data from the U.S. Department of Transportation we show the usefulness of our interactive visualization for conveying graph algorithm dynamics.",

For these and other reasons, email has become a source of stress; pushing us apart rather than bringing us together. In this paper, we describe POEM (People-Oriented EMail), a prototype email client designed to restore and strengthen email’s socially connective role. Because much of human communication is non-verbal, POEM features a visualization that summarizes user’s inbox by correspondent, using their profile pictures. To highlight human relationships, POEM offers access to detailed correspondent messages only by clicking on their pictures. Encouraging deeper relationships, POEM organizes correspondents by social importance measures including communication effort, balance, and delay before response. We conclude by sketching our plans to evaluate POEM.",

They contain a wealth of information about the opinions and experiences of users, which help better understand consumer decisions and improve products and services. However, the huge volume of reviews makes it difficult for potential customers to gain useful insights and for managers to track customer opinions. To address these problems, we first use topic modeling techniques for customer opinion mining. Then, we build a deep learning network for sentiment analysis. Finally, we perform sentiment analysis of the reviews at the aspect level to obtain the sentiment vector representation of the accommodation. Moreover, we design a visual analytic system with a user-friendly interface to facilitate interactive analysis. Evaluation including user and case studies demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of this system.",

In order for the fluid solution to be stable, we take a more reliable surface particles detection method in the solver. On this basis, instead of computing implicit function from all fluid particles, we only use surface particles by means of SPR. In order to build a smoother, feature-preserved surface, we adapt a fluid particles pre-processing pipeline to compensate for the defects of fluid particles applied to SPR. In experiment, we demonstrate how the SPR can benefit from our pre-processing pipeline and a significant improvement in quality of reconstructed surfaces as compared to existing methods.",

In this paper we describe a visual analysis tool that takes into account a multitude of educational data sources, filters those into the most relevant ones, and derives attributes-of-interest which form a high-dimensional dataset. For this data we apply t-SNE as one possible projection method to visualize and uncover similarities and dissimilarities among the high-dimensional attributes in a lower-dimensional space like in a scatter plot. We also support interaction techniques and further visual variables to encode additional data attributes in the form of color codings, sizes, and shapes.

In order to confidently know when and how treemaps can best be applied, the research community uses usability studies and controlled experiments to \"understand the potential and limitations of our tools\" (Plaisant, 2004). To support the communities' understanding and usage of treemaps, this survey provides a comprehensive review and detailed overview of 69 user studies related to treemaps. However, due to pitfalls and shortcomings in design, conduct, and reporting of the user studies, there is little that can be reliably derived or accepted as a generalized statement. Fundamental open questions include configuration, compatible tasks, use cases, and perceptional characteristics of treemaps. The reliability of findings and statements is discussed and common pitfalls of treemap user studies are identified.",

The tool provides ways to upload, share, explore, and compare hierarchical data using a multitude of different linked hierarchy visualizations. The current version supports up to 8 hierarchy visualizations, with the space-reclaiming icicle plots among them. Several of the visualizations can be shown in linked views while typical hierarchy parameters and visual variables can be changed on user demand. The interactive tool makes use of OpenGL and Angular, an industry standard JavaScript platform, and runs in a web browser. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to the NCBI taxonomy that consists of more than 300,000 hierarchically organized species while filtering for the tetrapoda subhierarchy. Finally, we explain implementation details and discuss limitations and scalability issues of the linked visualization techniques.",

However, due to the sparseness of record data and the difference in service regions, the relationship between them is indeed obscure, and previous solutions mostly focus only on a single system. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics system to investigate the similarities and differences between bike-sharing and taxi systems. The service region for each bike station is created to fuse bike-sharing data and taxi data. We harness two 3-order tensors to represent them in a unified framework to generate potential patterns by tensor decomposition. The visual analytics system integrates two spatiotemporal data sources by analyzing the patterns that are typical of each data source and the patterns that are common to both data sources to assist users in better discovering the relationships between the taxi system and the bike-sharing system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through real-world case studies.",

Understanding the users' travel behavior is invaluable for policy makers and related companies. However, it is difficult to capture the spatio-temporal cycling patterns based on sparse bike-sharing data. In this paper, we analyze the dockless bike-sharing data using tensor decomposition method. A three-dimensional tensor is constructed first, and a tensor decomposition method is employed to detect the underlying travel patterns. Several visual components are designed to show the extracted patterns. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

For example, physical growth data for age 7-18 has been collected every a few months for up to seven years; therefore, only short growth pattern pieces exist in the data. When using previous prediction techniques, it is challenging to create a growth prediction model that reflects individual growth patterns. Also, uncertainties in predicted results emerge since the overall trend of the data is unknown. In this work, we present a predictive analysis and modeling to forecast incomplete data over time. We extend the Bayesian network model, which is relative data-driven approaches that explore similar data and weave them to create approximate inference margins. Besides, we propose a visual analytics system that enables us to design various predictive models that reflect individual growth pattern. Our visual analytics system assists us to discover new growth patterns in the process of analyzing the accuracy of previously designed predictive models. Moreover, the system allows us to optimize predictive models to fit unusual growth patterns.",

Epidemiologists have to analyze this epidemiological data on a regular basis. They use this spatio-temporal information, most of which is shared online, to detect, observe, and track geographic locations of disease outbreaks over time. Unfortunately, manually retrieving the data from a website like Google News and then deriving sensible insights from the huge dataset consumes a lot of time and effort. We present EpidNews, a new visual analytics tool that helps to visualize and explore epidemiological news data for animals. The tool uses several views depicting various levels of abstraction, which helps fulfill almost all the data analysis requirements of epidemiologists. We also present the case study of an epidemiology expert, wherein she assesses the usability and productivity of EpidNews by using the tool in her daily work.",

    "abstract": "Effective visualisation plays a vital role in generating insights from data. The selection of graph types however, is highly dependent on the analysis tasks and data types at hand. For example, spatio-temporal visualisations encode changes in data over time and space. Although they have the potential of revealing overall tendencies and movement patterns, building effective spatio-temporal visualisations is challenging because it requires encoding all three attributes of spatio-temporal data i.e. thematic (values of attributes), temporal and spatial in a single visualisation. In this application design study, we present PedaViz for representing hour-level spatio-temporal attributes within a single visualisation; a 24-hour radial visual metaphor that encodes hour-level temporal and daily temperature attributes while utilising a thematic map display to present spatial attributes. The design was applied on city planning domain using Melbourne's pedestrian count and temperature data. Results of our preliminary user evaluation suggest that our visualisation is easily understandable by users; and supports users in carrying out selected analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "Visualization of customer behavior is urgently needed for an increasing number of customer orders on O2O (online to offline) platform. Although many works have been done on visualizing customer opinion or customer click events of one store, visualizing customer switching behavior among stores is still challenging. The challenge is to show customer order records over time and structure the inter-connection among different stores when customer switching behavior happens. In this work, we focus on Takeout O2O service to present a novel visual analysis system for retailers focusing on customer switching behavior patterns. Firstly we define five customer segments based on switching behavior. Then this system enables temporal-spatial driver exploration for different segments through several interactive views. Moreover, in order to visualize inter-connection sequences, augmented streamgraph with the bundled parallel coordinates is proposed as one alternative technique to visualize temporal event sequences. Case studies through collaboration with domain experts also demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this system in helping customer relationship management.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an image-space contrast enhancement method for color-encoded visualization. The contrast of an image is enhanced through a perceptually-guided approach that interfaces with the user with a single and intuitive parameter of the virtual viewing distance. To this end, we analyze a multiscale contrast model of the input image and test the visibility of bandpass images of all scales at a virtual viewing distance. By adapting weights of bandpass images with a threshold model of spatial vision, this image-based method enhances contrast to compensate for contrast loss caused by viewing the image at a certain distance. Relevant features in the color image can be further emphasized by the user using overcompensation. The method is efficient and can be integrated into any visualization tool as it is a generic image-based post-processing technique. Using highly diverse datasets, we show the usefulness of perception compensation across a wide range of typical visualizations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we take a look into typical interaction scenarios when it comes to visualizing hierarchical data while we particularly focus on one specific candidate that is the visual depiction by generalized Pythagoras trees. Those are visualizations that benefit from their aesthetically appealing appearance since they come close to a visual model of trees growing in nature. Traditionally, those generalized Pythagoras trees are visualized on typical computer screens, clearly indicating the hierarchy, but negatively, the finer substructures are oftentimes not visible anymore due to the display space restriction and the low resolution. Hence, in this paper we describe the generalized Pythagoras trees displayed on largescale high-resolution displays and illustrate the challenges and perspectives when we have to interact with the visual representation by using the technique individually, but also in collaboration. To explore possible interactions we experimented with tablet computers combined with an optical tracking system. We evaluate the effectiveness and aesthetics by means of several modifiable visual parameters and by interacting with the visualization.",

    "abstract": "Shape grammars are powerful in specifying and generating an infinite number of designs by repeatedly applying predefined transformation rules to initial shapes. However, the intractable nature of shape grammars limits its wide use in many applications. Moreover, shape grammars lack a parsing method to automatically validate generated designs. In this paper, we present an approach capable of generating tractable designs and validating generated designs. Our approach transforms polygonal shapes and shape rules in shape grammars to graphs and then uses the spatial graph grammar (SGG) formalism to generate and parse designs. We have evaluated our approach by transforming shapes and shape rules originally specified in a shape grammar for Turkish houses to our graph representation and validating designs with the transformed graph rules on VEGGIE, a graph grammar specification and induction tool. Other shape grammars can be potentially integrated with our approach to extend their capability in generating and validating designs.",

On the other hand, such a move poses many difficulties, one of which is how to arrange content in a 3D space. This task becomes further complicated when the story-graph of the presentation is evolving and is more complex than a single linear story-path. In this work, we propose a framework for automatically solving the task of 3D content placement, which is based on views --- 3D replacement for slides. We also examplify our proposed approach with two spatial layouts for 3D non-linear presentations: \"nested spheres\" and a 'building', as well as algorithms that automatically create these layouts from an abstract hierarchical story-graph.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing and visualizing call relations can provide useful insights into the connectivities and linkings of certain parts of a software system. This can in particular be a good strategy to find software system parts that are interlinked a lot while others typically occur as more or less stand-alone components not called by many others. The challenging problem with call relation data comes from the dynamics of the data, i.e., a call graph can be changing either during the development of a software system or during the execution of the software. The second case mostly leads to long graph sequences changing on a fine-granular temporal scale requiring a suitable overview-based dynamic graph visualization technique. Moreover, identifying certain temporal patterns in the graph evolution can help to detect certain phases of either the evolution of a software system or phases during the execution that can show which components are connected while someone interacts with the runnable software for example. This can particularly be based on graph, layout, or attribute properties, all providing different perspectives on the dynamics of the graph data. We illustrate the usefulness of our visualization technique by applying it to the open source software project JHotDraw. The call graphs are recorded during runtime while typical user interactions are applied.",

    "abstract": "The Internet is constantly evolving and changing over time. Outages, attacks, upgrades, censorships, and policy changes modify the routing very frequently everywhere in the world. To give the possibility to the Internet Service Providers and to the network operators of monitoring such an evolving scenario, many organizations collect the routing changes and give free access to them. We propose, prototype, and evaluate a visual interface, called Upstream Visibility, to display such data. It is based on three views: (1) a global view that, based on stacked area charts, gives the high level trend of the visibility of an IP prefix; (2) a local view allows the user to check the effects over time of the visibility of an IP prefix on specific locations of the network; and (3) a traditional graph animation view. Also, we propose heuristics for producing such type of drawings, evaluating their effectiveness and performance against scenarios describing well-known Internet incidents.",

    "abstract": "Lots of movies are produced every year, too many to watch all of them and in particular, to get an overview about the evolution of typical movie genres and actors playing in them. Moreover, it is a challenging problem to detect correlations among the movies and the actors in those movies, in particular, if we are interested in time-varying data patterns like trends, countertrends, or anomalies and outliers. Those correlations are specifically interesting if they can be inspected on different levels of granularity, e.g., temporal, but also hierarchical in form of country- or continent-based correlations. In this paper we describe the IMDb Explorer, a web-based visualization tool that consists of two major views denoted by the movie cosmos and the career lines. Both views are linked and interactively manipulable while a list of user-defined metrics are explorable. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to the entire movie database provided by IMDb.",

Opinions, stances, arguments, topics, terms, and text documents are usually connected with many-to-many relationships for such tasks. Exploratory visual analysis with interactive tools can help the analysts to get an overview of the topics and opinions, identify particularly interesting documents, and describe main themes of various arguments. In our previous work, we introduced an interactive tool called Topics2Themes that was used for topic and theme analysis of vaccination-related discussion texts with a limited set of stance categories. In this poster paper, we describe an application of Topics2Themes to a different genre of data, namely, political comments from Reddit, and multiple sentiment and stance categories detected with automatic classifiers.",

Thus, it is important to explore how e-health related information is generated and disseminated in these platforms. The aim of our current efforts is to investigate the content and flow of information when people in Sweden use Twitter to talk about diabetes related issues. To achieve our goals, we have used data mining and visualization techniques in order to explore, analyze and cluster Twitter data we have collected during a period of 10 months. Our initial results indicate that patients use Twitter to share diabetes related information and to communicate about their disease as an alternative way that complements the traditional channels used by health care professionals.",

    "abstract": "Due to the continuous increase in the scale of numerical simulations, research on visualization has shifted to in-situ/in-transit approaches. The interactivity of largescale visualization has also become increasingly important. In order to observe largescale visualization data in detail, high-resolution displays, such as those with 8K or 16K resolutions, give an opportunity to inspire new discovery. With the commoditization of high-resolution displays, tiled display walls (TDWs) have facilitated their use for the collaborative research, where a large screen size is required for sharing the content among multiple sites. In this paper, we propose a remote collaboration method that utilizes a TDW driver (ChOWDER), which enables content sharing among multiple sites even with different display configurations, and a visualization application (HIVE) for dynamic content sharing of interactive visualization results.",

    "abstract": "Fashion styles often change over time, but why and how certain fashion clothes become out of style is rarely investigated. Researchers have long been interested in understanding why and how some fashion styles last long, while others are short lived. Our research demonstrates that the adoption speed affects fashion evolution. We analyze data obtained from the VOGUE magazine on clothes' frequency of appearance. Results show that cloth styles adopted quickly would become unfashionable faster. This may help understanding fashion consumption and thus guide the marketing effort.",

    "abstract": "Using predictive models for data-driven optimization of production lines is a trending topic in manufacturing. A challenge is to support the visualization and management of data and arising uncertainties in various phases. Modern production lines can contain thousands of sensors to collect readings every few milliseconds. When creating predictive models for optimization from this data, its sheer amount not only poses challenges to data storage and management, but also during the different phases of data preparation, modeling, decision making, and executing optimizations. Our research aims at a better support of all these phases with data visualization, with new strategies for the management of uncertainty. Predictive models help operators to identify problems and the degree of wear of tools or parts in production lines. However, data analysts, supervisors, and service technicians must be aware that these models contain uncertainties and the recommendations made by these models should be critically reflected before acceptance. One way to mitigate the negative impact of uncertainties is to use visualization as tool for analyzing the potentials and limits of prediction models. Therefore, we propose a process model for the different activities of optimization in a smart production environment and discuss challenges for the visualization of data and uncertainty in each step.",

However, fuzzy clustering results will become complex and high-dimensional membership degree matrixes when they contain a large number of data points and multiple clusters. In this paper, we propose a Radviz-based interactive visualization to help users understand fuzzy clustering results. Firstly, we utilize the projection mechanism of Radviz to map the membership degree matrixes onto planar and radial pictures, in which data points with low membership uncertainty are located near Radviz circumference, while the others are scattered in the center of Radviz circle. To provide an informative interactive visualization, we then improve traditional Radviz visualization in many aspects, including implementing an optimal and uneven placement of dimension anchors by using the Prim algorithm, designing visual codings of data points and dimension arcs to express statistical information, combining chord diagram to depict the sharing relationship between clusters, and offering a set of interactions to support deeper exploration. Finally, we use a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our visualization.",

Efficient parsing mechanisms are essential to these formalisms. However, the existent parsing algorithms are either inefficient or confined to a minority of graph grammars. This paper introduces the notion of partial precedence, defines the partial precedence graph of a graph grammar and theoretically unveils the existence of a valid parsing path conforming to the topological orderings of the partial precedence graph. Then, it provides algorithms for computing the partial precedence graph and presents an approach to improving general parsing algorithms with the graph based on the drawn conclusion. It is shown that the approach can considerably improve the efficiency of general parsing algorithms.",

But when dealing with large-scale data, there is room for improvement with regard to three issues: insufficient memory space, large time consumption and weak data expression. Therefore, this paper introduces the idea of cluster analysis to the storyline to present the clustering information and reduce the time complexity under the condition where a large number of entities interact in the same period. Meantime a scalable, reusable visualization library of storyline is implemented including some novel interactions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, people can do most of their personal tasks, such as banking on smart devices like personal computers (PCs). Especially, Malware targeted at personal information stored on mobile are hard to detect and risks from usage patterns are even more difficult. Therefore, a means for easy recognition of the problems and the smartphone usage is necessary. In this paper, we present a personal visual analytics (PVA) system for Android security risk lifelog using app permissions to recognize the risk. Our system stores the security-related personal information on the smartphone device and utilizes it to analyze the security risk lifelog. For the risk analysis, we define security risk scores based on the app and permission statistics. Then, several linked visualizations are designed to present the risk lifelog. We have collected the security lifelog data from eight Android smartphone users and analyzed their security matters. Our PVA system enables Android smartphone users to observe, mitigate the security risk, and eventually understand how Android security risk affects their lives. Moreover, we present a user study to evaluate the PVA system with user feedback.",

One example is the visualization of the energy output of power plants. We present a web-based application that aims to provide information about the energy production of a specified region, along with location information about the power plants. The application is intended to be used as a solid data basis for political discussions, nudging, and story telling about the German energy transition to renewables, called \"Energiewende\". It was therefore designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and provide information for a broad spectrum of users that do not need any domain-specific knowledge. Users are able to select different categories of power plants and look up their positions on an overview map. Glyphs indicate their exact positions and a selection mechanism allows users to compare the power output on different time scales using stacked area charts or ThemeRivers. As an evaluation of the application, we have collected web access statistics and conducted an online survey with respect to the intuitiveness, usability, and informativeness.",

    "abstract": "Following recent advances in visual interfaces for search, we investigate how to visualize activity traces to support collaborative information-seeking. We implemented a prototype system that visualizes traces of three types of activities (queries typed, articles bookmarked, and interested keywords) on top of a recent visual search system. The current interface of the system provides an interactive keyword visualization to support exploratory search. We designed two icons to visualize user interactions with the keywords and articles. We also implemented a time line to explicitly display the issued queries and additional details about the interactions. We conducted a longitudinal user study to evaluate the usability of these visualizations. We found that the visualization of traces of issued queries and bookmarked articles help the users to better monitor the progress of the collaborators, increase collaboration, and reassure their findings. Traces of interested keywords support sub-topic identification. Furthermore, activity traces of collaborators help the users to learn about the system features. The findings and the novel collaborative system provide valuable insights and tools into future research on designing interfaces for collaborative information-seeking.",

While in time series analysis many established methods require data that are sampled in regular time intervals, in practice sensors may sample data at varying interval lengths. Time series rastering is the process of aggregating unequally spaced time series into equal interval lengths. In this paper we discuss critical aspects in the context of time series rastering, and we present a visual design which supports the parametrization of the rastering transformation, communicates the introduced uncertainties and quality issues, and facilitates the comparison of alternative rastering outcomes to achieve optimal results.",

To exploit machine learning techniques for detecting anomaly status, we should prepare suitable models to express the statuses of moving objects in advance. In this paper, several variations of vector models are introduced. These vector models express the relative trajectories of two moving objects approaching each other. To investigate the features of the vector models, the authors tried to observe them by using panel matrices. By means of visualizations using a panel matrix, we can easily grasp the dependence of vector models to parameters and the similarity among variations of the models.",

The traditional Stock Chart provides limited information to investors as it only displays the price changes of the stock over a period of time. More information could be incorporated in the plot such as the return of a stock, the risk of a stock and the performance of the corporation issuing the stock. Based on the information what an investor concerns most about investment activities, a new style visualization method based on Parallel Coordinates is proposed.

    "abstract": "Apriori Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a popular data mining technique for deriving association rules from frequent itemsets, and it has a long history. Despite of its popularity, its performance suffers from a bottleneck in scalability. Many attempts were made in the past, including changing the frequent item database structure to sophisticated parallel execution. In this paper an alternative strategy is proposed which centred on segmenting the database in lieu of using the full database. The segmentation is by ensemble method which sifts and selects the most effective clustering algorithm; the resultant segmented data cluster is subsequently used for ARM. Using only a fraction of data transactions which supposedly has a high concentration of expressive data, ARM produces higher quality association rules at shorter time. The proposed ARM model is tested using three cases - bank, homicide and lung cancer. The results confirm the usefulness of this new model - higher quality rules are gained",

A gene co-expression network is created by computing the correlation between each gene pair in a gene-set. We transform the networks into scale-free networks in order to calculate the dissimilarity weights that are used to create our profiles. Our approach further distinguishes between gene pairs consisting of both, one, or no statistically significant genes. We find that the shapes and density of the profiles provide useful information for identification of disease gene biomarkers. Our results provide a means of visualizing the overall distribution of gene dissimilarity for each gene-set, as well as how gene dissimilarity is linked to the mutual significance of gene pairs within a gene-set.",

This machine learning-based approach can provide extracted useful information from large body of texts, in a reasonable time. However, the results are usually in complicated forms, which meant it is a non-trivial task in term of interpretation. In this paper, we present appropriate visualizations and analyses in order to tackle the tangled network representing relationship between entities (i.e. terms extracted from raw text). Conducted on a case study of information extraction in the business management domain, our results reveal the hidden relationships of inter-organizational success factors in a simple structured way.

    "abstract": "We present a preliminary design study for utilizing eye tracking to support interacting with a multi-document visualization. Complex information seeking tasks can involve collection and comparison of multiple documents, resulting in long and sustained search sessions. The sustained and evolving nature of the session also provides the search interface the opportunity to gather information on the user state and interaction history, which can be used to adapt the information content and representation. We designed a system to evaluate how eye tracking information can be used for adapting the visual salience of information entities. The interface features documents and related keywords that are arranged in a radial layout configuration called the intent radar. Reading history and visual attention, as registered by eye tracking data, are respectively used to trace read items and for visual cueing. We evaluated the interface with 16 participants to gather subjective feedback about specific components and features of the interface. The overall results show that the interface and gaze-related appearance of keywords was positively received by the users.",

    "abstract": "The mandala thangka, as a religious art in Tibetan Buddhism, is an invaluable cultural and artistic heritage. However, drawing a mandala is both time and effort consuming and requires mastery skills due to its intricate details. Retaining and digitizing this heritage is an unresolved research challenge to date. In this paper, we propose a computer-aided generation approach of mandala thangka patterns to address this issue. Specifically, we construct parameterized models of three stylistic patterns used in the interior mandalas of Nyingma school in Tibetan Buddhism according to their geometric features, namely the star, crescent and lotus flower patterns. Varieties of interior mandalas are successfully generated using these proposed patterns based on the hierarchical structures observed from hand drawn mandalas. The experimental results show that our approach can efficiently generate beautifully-layered colorful interior mandalas, which significantly reduces the time and efforts in manual production and, more importantly, contributes to the digitization of this great heritage.",

    "abstract": "The visual analysis of eye movement data is a challenging task since the data has an inherent spatio-temporal nature and is typically recorded by measuring the eye movements of various study participants and sometimes, over long time periods. Finding similar strategies among the participants while applying a visual scanning strategy is one of the most important but also most difficult tasks. In this paper we describe the eye movement plots with which we are able to visually encode the eye movement fixation sequences of several study participants as a stacked line-based representation. The two-dimensional fixation points are mapped to a time-dependent sequence of lines while edge splatting is applied to visually augment the otherwise cluttered diagrams. With this visualization concept, time-varying eye movement patterns become visible, comparable, and generate an overview representation for a set of eye movements allowing comparison tasks. We illustrate the usefulness of the technique by means of applying it to formerly recorded eye tracking data by investigating route finding tasks in public transport systems. Moreover, we describe challenges, limitations, and scalability issues of the approach.",

Those multivariate data are too complex for laymen like museum visitors to first, get an overview about all paintings and to look for specific categories. Finally, the goal is to guide the visitor to a specific painting that he wishes to have a more closer look on. In this paper we describe an interactive visualization tool that first provides such an overview and lets people experiment with the more than 41,000 paintings collected in the web gallery of art. To generate such an interactive tool, our technique is composed of different steps like data handling, algorithmic transformations, visualizations, interactions, and the human user working with the tool with the goal to detect insights in the provided data. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to such characteristic data and show how one can get from an overview about all paintings to specific paintings.",

    "abstract": "Treemaps have been used in information visualisation for over two decades. They make use of nested filled areas to represent information hierarchies such as file systems, library catalogues, etc. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of visualisations that resemble geographic maps. In this paper we present a study that compares the performance of one such map-like visualisation with the original two forms of the treemap, namely nested and non-nested treemaps. Our study focused on a quantitative evaluation of accuracy and speed. We found that accuracy was highest for the map-like visualisations, followed by nested treemaps and lastly non-nested treemaps. Task performance was fastest for nested treemaps, followed by non-nested treemaps, and then map-like visualisations. We conclude that the results regarding accuracy are promising for the use of map-like visualisations in tasks involving the visualisation of hierarchical information, even at the expense of somewhat longer performance times.",

This paper addresses the following question: does manipulating the size of visual elements affect the comprehension of LineSets? We empirically evaluated two types of size treatments applied to LineSets drawn on networks: varying set-line thickness, to reflect relative set cardinality, and varying node diameter, to reflect data items' relative degree of connectivity. The evaluation required participants to perform tasks that were thought to be aided by the size variations alongside tasks where no benefit was anticipated. Viewing comprehension through accuracy and time performance, we found that varying set-line thickness and node diameter significantly improves the effectiveness of LineSets. As a consequence, this research leads to the recommendation that LineSets vary sizes of lines and nodes.",

    "abstract": "Data Analysts have to deal with an ever-growing amount of data resources. One way to make sense of this data is to extract features and use clustering algorithms to group items according to a similarity measure. Algorithm developers are challenged when evaluating the performance of the algorithm since it is hard to identify features that influence the clustering. Moreover, many algorithms can be trained using a semi-supervised approach, where human users provide ground truth samples by manually grouping single items. Hence, visualization techniques are needed that help data analysts achieve their goal in evaluating Big data clustering algorithms. In this context, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) has become a prominent visualization tool. In this paper, we propose a combination with glyphs that can provide a detailed view of specific features involved in MDS. In consequence, human users can understand, adjust, and ultimately improve clustering algorithms. We present a thorough glyph design, which is founded in a comprehensive survey of related work and report the results of a controlled experiments, where participants solved data analysis tasks with both glyphs and a traditional textual display of data values.",

    "abstract": "Ontologies describe complex world knowledge in that they consist of hierarchical relations, such as is-a, which can be expressed by quantifiers or sets, and various binary relations, which can be expressed by links or networks. Should hierarchical relations be distinguished from other binary relations as essentially different ones in building cognitively accessible systems of ontologies? In this study, two kinds of ontology visualizations, a network-based visualization (SOVA) and a set-based visualization (concept diagrams), are empirically compared in the case of consistency checking. Participants were presented with one diagram and then asked to answer the question of whether the meaning of the diagram was contradictory. Our results showed that SOVA is more effective than concept diagrams, suggesting that to represent hierarchical and binary relations of ontologies in a way based on networks suits human cognition when checking ontologies' consistencies.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing dynamic call graphs is typically done by providing a visual representation that shows the sequence of static graphs placed next to each other. Such a time-to-space mapping is useful to visually compare the graphs and to see the changing graph structure, but, negatively, a view on changes between all pairs of graphs in the sequence is not provided and detecting similarities of longer call graph subsequences is not well supported. In this paper we describe the dynamic call graph matrix that shows similarities and differences between graph pairs in a graph sequence by applying certain well-known set operations as well as fine-grained and coarse-grained graph views supporting visual scalability. We illustrate the usefulness of our technique by applying it to dynamic call graph data from the open source software project JUnit that contains several inherent dynamic call graph features worth investigating and hard to find by a side-by-side dynamic graph visualization alone.",

However, in many situations it is useful to provide set membership information for elements in networks. We present BranchingSets, an interactive visualization technique that uses visual encodings similar to Kelp Diagrams in order to augment traditional node-link diagrams with information about the categories that both nodes and links belong to. BranchingSets introduces novel user-driven methods to procedurally navigate the graph topology and to interactively inspect complex, hierarchical data associated with individual nodes. Results indicate that users find the technique engaging and easy to use. This is further confirmed by a quantitative study that compares the effectiveness of the visual encodings used in BranchingSets to other techniques for displaying set membership within node-link diagrams, finding our technique more accurate and more efficient for facilitating interactive queries on networks containing nodes that belong to multiple sets.",

    "abstract": "Reading academic paper is a daily task for researchers and graduate students. However, reading effectively can be challenging, particularly for novices in scientific research. For example, when readers are reading the related work section that cites a fair number of references in limited page space, they often need to flip back and forth between the text and the references and may also frequently search elsewhere for more information about the references. This increases the difficulty of understanding a paper. In this paper, we propose a narrative visualization system that helps the reading of academic papers. As a first step, we adopt narrative visualization to present literature review as interactive slides. Specifically, we propose a narrative structure with three levels of granularities that the reader can drill down or roll up freely. The logic flow of a slideshow can be organized based on the paper's presentation or citations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through several case studies and user studies. The results show that the system allows users to quickly track and glance related work, making paper reading more effective and enjoyable.",

However, huge amounts of raw data, coupled with incomplete or inconsistent records, may turn into an obstacle for the effective use of the available information. The need for effective movement data analysis has resulted in a large number of visual analytics tools and specialized views. There are still many challenges in public transportation and other kinds of cyclic movement data analysis. In this paper we address some of those challenges by presenting an improvement of the standard map view. This improved view is specifically designed to simplify and make the visual analysis of complex movement data easier to perform, especially when integrated in a coordinated multiple views tool and articulated together with other techniques. We illustrate the effectiveness of the view on public transportation data from Bahía Blanca, Argentina.",

    "abstract": "Image saliency is a biologically inspired concept for characterizing visual conspicuity of individual features in natural images, and provides us with a useful insight into the mechanism for directing instant visual attention from viewers. Nevertheless, this perceptual quality often remains to be further sophisticated especially for enhancing saliency in infographic images since they usually consist of relatively simple visual pattens that result in sharp image edges rather than smooth gradations in natural images. This paper presents a new approach to intentionally drawing visual attention for infographic images, in such a way that the corresponding important features naturally pop up in the image. The idea behind our approach is to introduce the concept of symmetry saliency for enhancing local symmetry inherent in such infographic images. This is accomplished by evaluating how much each image edge contributes to the symmetry saliency, and augmenting the corresponding image gradient in proportion to the amount of its contribution. The intensity field of the given image is then modulated with such enhanced image edges by solving the Poisson equation. Several examples together with statistics obtained through a user study demonstrate that our proposed approach successfully improves the readability of infographic images and effectively attracts visual attention to intended regions of interest.",

    "abstract": "Clarity, simplicity and visual adjustability to the preference of the analyst are key aspects of the visualization techniques required by visual analytics in broad sense. Scatterplots and scatterplot matrices are commonly used for visually analyzing multidimensional multivariate data. This paper presents a new approach for deep visual exploration of large multi-attribute data using linkable scatterplots. Proposed method overcomes the limitations of the single scatterplot by providing more plot panels for better comparison while it reduces the unnecessary number of panels of the scatterplot matrix method. The panels are fully interactive and linking together where variables can be mapped on axes independently or on common visual attributes such as color, size and shape. We illustrate the effectiveness of proposed linkable scatterplot method on various data sets.",

To address this issue, we present visibility widgets: compact auxiliary views that visualize occluded data, their locations, and related properties, and thus, support users in revealing hidden information. Our widgets comprise different occlusion management strategies for detecting and analyzing invisible data inside as well as outside of the field of view. In addition, each widget is designed complementary and transient to facilitate interactive exploration and navigation while not monopolizing the user's attention. We demonstrate the application of our visibility widgets in a flexible visualization tool, focusing on visual exploration of hazardous weather phenomena in 3D terrain.",

    "abstract": "The output of 3D volume segmentation is crucial to a wide range of endeavors. Producing accurate segmentations often proves to be both inefficient and challenging, in part due to lack of imaging data quality (contrast and resolution), and because of ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of the structure and the context wherein it resides. Automatic and semi-automatic approaches are improving, but in many cases still fail or require substantial manual clean-up or intervention. Expert manual segmentation and review is therefore still the gold standard for many applications. Unfortunately, existing tools (both custom-made and commercial) are often designed based on the underlying algorithm, not the best method for expressing higher-level intention. Our goal is to analyze manual (or semi-automatic) segmentation to gain a better understanding of both low-level (perceptual tasks and actions) and high-level decision making. This can be used to produce segmentation tools that are more accurate, efficient, and easier to use. Questioning or observation alone is insufficient to capture this information, so we utilize a hybrid capture protocol that blends observation, surveys, and eye tracking. We then developed, and validated, data coding schemes capable of discerning low-level actions and overall task structures.",

    "abstract": "Using mobile devices to collaborate with other users on a large shared screen supports collaborative tasks and prevents interference among users. Various intuitive gestures have been proposed to support interaction across a tabletop and a mobile device. Different from previous studies that focused on designing gestures, this paper investigates the fundamental difference between one-handed and two-handed interaction styles that involve a tabletop and a mobile device. In the study, we consider two factors, i.e., the selection order (sequential or random order) and the density level (sparse or dense layout), which form four tasks. The study was conducted as a pretest-posttest, repeated-measures experiment. All the participants go through all the tasks using both interaction styles. During the experiment, both the completion time and the error rate in each task with each interaction style are recorded. In addition, the IBM Post-Study Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) is used to evaluate the subjective satisfaction on each interaction style. The overall PSSUQ score indicates that both interaction styles receive positive feedback with high user satisfaction. The one-handed interaction is significantly more efficient than the two-handed interaction in all four tasks. On the other hand, the two-handed interaction has a lower error rate than the one-handed interaction, especially significantly lower in a dense layout.",

Apart from this obvious purpose, the metaphor of maps has been applied to other uses as well, such as information visualisation and novel user interfaces. Various methods exist for creating geographic map-like visualisations. Yet there is little understanding on how people perceive these graphical presentations as geographic maps, and how to make these information visualisations look like geographic maps. We attempt to find preliminary answers on these issues by conducting a user study with a series of map-like visualisations. In this paper, we report on the results of this study and reveal the factors that have an impact on the human perception of visualisations that are designed to resemble geographic maps. Based on this, we propose design suggestions for the future development of map-like visualisations.",

When one estimates relative values relying on visual stimuli, perceptual bias may weaken the accuracy and bring about risks. This research explores how people estimate relative values heuristically using visual cues with different dimensional information, i.e., linear, areal and volumetric information. We conduct experiments to empirically testify the influences of dimensional information on perceptual biases. First, we confirm the conspicuity of areal information. When instructed to estimate rates exclusively relying on either linear or volumetric information, people would inevitably be influenced by the corresponding rates determined by areal information. Second, we provide evidences that visual cues implying depth would lead to overestimates. This research provides implications for designers to enhance the power of visual persuasions, and for users to improve their decision making quality.",

Existing solutions of mining interesting association rules are based on the support-confidence theory. However, it is non-trivial for the user to understand and modify the rules or the results of intermediate steps in the mining process, because the interestingness of rules might differ largely for various tasks and users. In this paper we propose to reinforce conventional association rule mining process by mapping the entire process into a visualization assisted loop, with which the user workload for modulating parameters and mining rules is reduced, and the mining efficiency is greatly improved. A matrix-based visualization technique is employed to encode the measure computation value, the data distribution and the intermediate results. We also design a set of visual exploration tools to support interactively inspection and manipulation of association measures, constraints of different types, and the results of intermediate steps. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The process of political decision making is often complex and tedious. The policy process consists of multiple steps, most of them are highly iterative. In addition, different stakeholder groups are involved in political decision making and contribute to the process. A series of textual documents accompanies the process. Examples are official documents, discussions, scientific reports, external reviews, newspaper articles, or economic white papers. Experts from the political domain report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability to keep track of the entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks for large sets of textual documents in the political decision making process. In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in political decision making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts. Finally, we present the results of three evaluation rounds, and reflect on our collaborative visualization system.",

However, exploring the spatiotemporal text data and characterizing the evolution of topics over time and space are challenging due to the complexity of such data and associated activities. This paper proposes a new approach to exploring the spatiotemporal text data with visual filters. We introduce a notion of topic trajectory to depict the spatiotemporal evolution of topics. Multiple coordinated visualizations provided in our visualization system enable users to explore topic trajectories and develop their contextual awareness in terms of how information flows across different regions. We demonstrate the use of our system with an analysis of a dataset contributed by users of widely used science mapping software CiteSpace.",

Numerous studies focus on the user's influence in different types of social network and visualize user and event propagation process. However, little works is done to visualize and analyze the social influence of breaking events. To fill this gap, we propose VIBES, a hybrid model that combines both event popularity and event public attention to quantitatively measure and visualize event social influence through time at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Experimental results based on two real-world event datasets from Weibo validate the effectiveness of VIBES for accurately capturing breaking sub-events as well as visualizing event social influence from different temporal granularity. The visualization results produced by VIBES are not only useful for public users to have a better understanding of breaking events, but also helpful for mass media and and government agencies to mediate and stabilize the outbreak of event.",

    "abstract": "Image mosaicing involves splitting an input image into a set of tiles, then replacing each tile with another image from a large dataset so that, when viewed from a distance, the resulting image resembles the original. We present a new approach for generating image mosaics using variable sized tiles made up from patches taken from photographs, paintings and texture images. This is different from previous work, where either simple regular tiling or adaptive tiling based on variations of RGB color was used. We propose an adaptive tiling theme by means of region entropy. In order to avoid the mismatch in roughness between the sub-image in the tile region of the input image and tile images in the dataset that may arise in the previous RGB color based image descriptors, we introduce the region entropy into the image descriptor to achieve better matching in both color and roughness. We also propose a new metric to measure the quality of the image mosaic which takes both the similarity and the mutual information between the generated mosaics and input images into account. The final mosaic images in this work are obtained by optimizing an objective function based on this metric.",

Combining the artist's aesthetic theory with the authors' own understanding, the paper analyzes the characteristics of Miro's work and proposes a process modeling approach that consists of four steps: structured drawing, adaptive coloring, space filling and noise injection. The generation process is described in details and sample generated images styled on Miro's paintings are also demonstrated and discussed. By extracting and coding pictorial elements in paintings of Miro, different styled images could be generated under different sets of parameters.",

Xuecheng area of Shandong Zao Zhuang is one of the oldest coal towns in China. Coal income is one of the main sources of local economy. Heavy dusts, produced by the coal mines and large cement plants, are seriously affecting the air quality index (AQI) and impairing local residents' health. Consequently, people in this area have to reduce their outdoor activities, which has led to loss of the town's vitality. In this paper, based on design strategy, the source of inspiration and medium and from the overall perspective, we design an innovative ecological Street Community Park, applying the concept of \"Cradle to Cradle\".",

    "abstract": "Digital big data provide the vast potential of increasing effectiveness and efficiency for decision making. Since the volume of the data is enormous, the data analysis requires large amount of time and effort. It is more problematic when predictive analysis is necessary for futuristic decision making. In order for predictive analysis, there have been many studies to forecast future trends spatiotemporally. However, most of studies provide just future tendency per event using graphs or maps without contextual compositive analysis. In this paper, we present a predictive visual analytics system to provide predictive event patterns. We infer the future event evolution by combining contextually similar cases occurring in the past. We utilize social media data to detect interesting abnormal events and match the detected abnormal events within the past news media data in order to retrieve similar event patterns. Then, we extract future event patterns through compositing contextual relationship among topics included in the similar past patterns. In order to evaluate our VA system, we demonstrate two use cases in this paper and validate our system with possible predictive story lines.",

The robot has a pan-tilt head equipped with a parametric speaker and a USB camera. A sighted trainer can observe the situation of a visually impaired trainee, and control the pan-tilt head to communicate with the trainee over the network. The trainer's voice is outputted from the parametric speaker and then reflected on the surface of a target object. The visually impaired trainee can hear the reflected voice as if it is generated from the object, and thus the robot can let the trainee know the object position. This robot system is applied to the ADL training where visually impaired individuals learn to use various objects arranged in their living environments. In this report, the experimental results of user study are shown.",

    "abstract": "The term code ownership is used in software engineering to describe who authored a certain piece of software. Code ownership is commonly determined by investigating the data from version control systems, defining the owner as the person who contributed the most lines to a file, module, etc. Existing visualisation for ownership usually relies on per-line annotations from the version control system, thus only conveying the information who changed a line the last time, potentially adding some visual cue about how old the respective change is. This, however, can be misleading, because any change of even a single character changes ownership. In this paper, we propose a visualisation that accounts for fractional ownership changes over time on a per-character basis. Our technique incorporates visual cues to convey that typical definitions of ownership have an inherent uncertainty and provides details on the cause of this uncertainty on demand. For our definition of code ownership being a low-level one, we propose implementing the visualisation as an in-situ visualisation in the code editor of modern development environments. We will show examples of the efficacy of our approach and discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional line-based ownership.",

    "abstract": "Scientific data is typically analyzed using visualizations. Large high-resolution displays can facilitate the analysis process since they offer more screen real estate than desktop monitors, which allows visualizing more data in greater detail and working collaboratively. On the other hand, mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are getting more and more popular but do not have sufficient graphics capabilities for advanced scientific visualizations. In this paper, we discuss a client application for Android devices that allows to remote control a scientific visualization framework. Combining the power of remote rendering with the availability, flexibility, and mobility of mobile devices results in a ubiquitous computing solution for scientific visualization. The user interaction with a large high-resolution display is only one possible application scenario. Other scenarios include presentation of results and remote visualization. The design of our Android application fulfills the requirement of all these application scenarios.",

Users of such systems can be overloaded with the displayed information and therefore it can take them more time to make a decision. In this paper, a novel visualization interface is presented, that can detect its user's cognitive overload and adapt the amount of information to be displayed and its visualization according to user's current cognitive capabilities. Results provided by the conducted user study have demonstrated that such adaptation technique benefits visualization interface efficiency.",

    "abstract": "CoVE is a novel, scalable, interactive tool that can be used to visualize and manage large colonies of laboratory animals. Effective management of large colonies of animals with multiple individual attributes and complicated breeding schemes represents a significant data management challenge in the biological sciences. Currently available software either provides databases for record keeping or generates basic pedigrees but not both. Thus, there is a pressing need for an integrated colony management system that provides a repository for the data and addresses the visualization challenge presented by complex genealogical data. We present CoVE, a colony visualization tool that provides an overview of the entire colony, clusters individuals based on Gender, Litter or Genotype, and provides an individual view of any animal for detailed examination. We demonstrate that CoVE provides an efficient way to manage, generate and view complex pedigree of real world genealogical data from animal colonies, annotated with details of individual attributes. It enables interactive tracing of lineages and identification of censored subjects in tumor studies.",

The existing multidimensional visualizations typically create visual clutter and over-plotting that make it difficult for interaction with data items directly. Our new space filling technique uses horizontal lines to represent multidimensional data items. Each line is logically divided into segments based on color mapping in order to denote the data item with its value. The proposed visualization is space efficient and also avoids the visual clutter and over-plotting problems as we have often observed in other visualizations. In addition, we allow user to interact directly with data on the display which is more intuitive and efficient than other means.",

In this paper, we apply the concept of small multiples representations to visually illustrate the dynamics of a graph. Node-link diagrams are used as the basic visual metaphor for displaying individual graphs of the sequence. To improve the readability of the diagram and reduce visual clutter we apply an edge splatting technique. Here, we discuss the benefits of splatted radial graph layouts on a modifiable 2D grid. Moreover, to obtain a more scalable dynamic graph visualization we interactively support a graph analyst by a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) feature to rapidly flip between the sequences of displayed graphs. The usefulness of the technique is illustrated in two case studies investigating a dynamic call graph and an evolving social network that consists of more than 1,000 graphs.",

    "abstract": "The bag-of-features models is one of the most popular and promising approaches for extracting the underlying semantics from image databases. However, the associated image categorization based on machine learning techniques may not convince us of its validity since we cannot visually verify how the images have been classified in the high-dimensional image feature space. This paper aims at visually rearrange the images in the projected feature space by taking advantage of a set of representative features called visual words obtained using the bag-of-features model. Our main idea is to associate each image with a specific number of visual words to compose a bipartite graph, and then lay out the overall set of images using anchored map representation in which the ordering of anchor nodes is optimized through a genetic algorithm. For handling relatively large image datasets, we adaptively merge a pair of most similar images one by one to conduct the hierarchical clustering through the similarity measure based on the weighted Jaccard coefficient. Voronoi partitioning has been also incorporated into our approach so that we can visually identify the image categorization based on support vector machine. Experimental results are finally presented to demonstrate that our visualization framework can effectively elucidate the underlying relationships between images and visual words through the anchored map representation.",

However, detailed information is also important in data analysis. When several lines overlap or are close to one another, distinguishing detailed information of polyline crossings is difficult. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the problem of polyline crossing ambiguity by using data labels. We place different labels along various polylines to give cues for differentiation of lines. We bend the lines and optimize the arrangement of curved lines to provide space for clear visible labels. An energy system that models attractive and repulsive forces of lines is used to guide the search for optimized line arrangement. The experiments on several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Visual notations are a key aspect of visual languages. They provide a direct mapping between the intended information and set of graphical symbols. Visual notations are most often implemented using the low level syntax of programming languages which is time consuming, error prone, difficult to maintain and hardly human-centric. In this paper we describe an alternative approach to generating visual notations using by-example model transformations. In our new approach, a semantic mapping between model and view is implemented using model transformations. The notations resulting from this approach can be reused by mapping varieties of input data to their model and can be composed into different visualisations. Our approach is implemented in the CONVErT framework and has been applied to many visualisation examples. Two case studies for visualising statistical charts and visualisation of traffic data are presented in this paper. A detailed user study of our approach for reusing notations and generating visualisations has been provided that shows good reusability and general acceptance of the novel approach.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of three-dimensional visual languages requires a wide range of conceptional and technical knowledge on issues for 3D graphics and textual language processing. Our generator framework DEViL3D incorporates such knowledge and supports the design of visual 3D languages and their implementation from high-level specifications. Such 3D languages arise from different modeling domains that make use of three-dimensional representations, e.g., the \"ball-and-stick\"models of molecules. The front-end of a 3D language implementation is a dedicated 3D graphical structure editor, which offers interaction and navigation techniques to construct programs in their domain. These techniques allow to manipulate the 3D program directly using operations to insert, move, and restructure objects. We have developed canned solutions for all such techniques that are encapsulated in visual patterns, which are provided by our generator. The designer of a particular 3D language only has to apply visual patterns to constructs of the abstract syntax, which defines the basic structure of the language. We have complemented our development with a usability study. Participants had to solve several tasks with different interaction or navigation techniques. The results partially indicate a significant advantage of one technique over another.",

Our system adopts a vision-based bare hand detection method which effectively detects the hand position and recognizes the hand gestures. Then, the corresponding sand manipulation actions are performed. Our system supports the common sand drawing functions, such as sand erosion, sand sand spilling, and sand leaking. To use hands to draw virtual sand on a drawing plane, we design four key gestures which enable drawing manipulation actions for sand. The basic idea is that the gesture of one hand controls the drawing action. The motion and gesture of the other hand controls the drawing position. Our preliminary experimental results show that our system enables sand drawing with bare hands using Kinect. A user study indicates our system is useful to sand art drawing.",

Infovis users with various roles in Infovis usually have different requirements for Infovis task modeling. Actually, Infovis research need a consistent taxonomy covering the tasks at different levels, or an interaction model that can facilitate Infovis system development with formal descriptions. But in fact, finding such a unified model is challenging. In this paper we propose a multilevel interaction model (MIM) for hierarchical tasks in Infovis systems. In MIM we define goal model, behavior model, and operation model that can model multilevel tasks in Infovis. In addition, we establish mapping models among MIM components, which can support Infovis systems design, development, application, and evaluation. Finally, we present a domain-specific Infovis application modeled by MIM. Application examples shows that MIM can effectively model multilevel tasks in Infovis and has potential to provide a framework enabling rapid prototyping of Infovis systems.",

End-users perceive web applications through user interfaces (UIs) and commonly use sketches of UIs to express their requirements. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an end-user development methodology centred on UI modelling techniques. In this paper a visual modelling approach is presented to empower end-users in developing data intensive web applications starting from user interface descriptions. The modelling language follows a holistic approach by representing both static and behavioural information of a web application in one visual model. The visual model allows the specification of the look-and-feel of the application through mock-ups, and the user interactions through links, annotations, and widget references. End-users are guided during the modelling process by providing a summary view to manage the design of complex applications and a data model view to improve the quality of the generated applications.",

    "abstract": "The visualization of complex physical processes is becoming a challenging topic in fields of information visualization, and attracting more and more researchers. Microstructure evolution visualization (MEV) has become an important and unsubstitutable method in the modern material processing engineering domains. A novel MEV approach combining the neutrosophic set theory (NS) and the cellular automaton technique (CA) is developed in order to precisely simulate the invisible, complex and unrepeatable physical process of metal solidification. The NS theory is applied to realize the complex evolution rules among three phases including solid phase, liquid phase and interface phase, while the CA method is used to simulate the dynamic process of dendrite growth. Experiment results of the dendrite growing simulation show strange consistency of the virtual invisible microstructure with that in practical industrial trials and production. Material experts also convince the statistical characteristics of the simulation results and further the inspirational value for the visualization of other complex physical processes.",

The method introduces an interactive straight prismatic construction space to realize the structure and shape variation of the example model simultaneously. The construction space defines the global size and the local shape feature of the desired model. Users can draw a closed curve and some skeleton lines by a sketch-based interface to design the construction space. Our algorithm first uses a quadrangulation algorithm to create a subdivision plane with the same contour as the closed curve. And the drawn skeleton lines control the local orientation of split units in the plane. Then it creates the construction space by sweeping the subdivision plane. Finally, it fills the construction space with the deformed model pieces while maintaining the generalized adjacent constraints, which are defined according to the example model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on large-scale complex models such as architecture, mountains.",

    "abstract": "As a novel type of real-time social networking service, microblogging has already become ubiquitous and an irreplaceable tool. Tracking in the pulse of retweeting propagation is important and meaningful. In this paper, we investigate how information propagation in a specific microblogging platform evolves to identify relevant patterns and understand dynamic attributes of information propagation and the underlying sociological motivations. More specifically, based on the node-link diagram, we propose three efficient strategies to map the multiple attributes of information propagation graph to appropriate visual elements. For revealing the dynamic attributes, we propose two models: the depth-varying and the time-varying parallel data model to illustrate the temporal evolution efficiently. We also present a novel method by combining the traditional scatter plot with Hough transformation to represent the distribution of propagation instances and trace the propagation speeds. We integrate our methods to a visual mining tool and develop several interactive features. We demonstrate how our approaches improve the understanding of the propagation graph from a visual perspective by employing propagation datasets collected from Sina Weibo, the largest microblogging service provider in mainland China. Meanwhile, this visual mining tool has been evaluated by data analysts and successfully used in Sina Corporation as a helpful assistant to them.",

However, the culture influence on people's aesthetic perception and experience has not been systematically explored. In the first part of our study, we measured the eye movements of Chinese and western participants while they viewed Chinese traditional Ink-wash paintings, and we found that the Chinese participants had longer fixation time in the white space areas than did the western participants. In the second part of the study, we measured their eye movements while they viewed different paintings composed by the linear perspective or scattered perspective techniques, and the results suggest that the western participants are more sensitive to the perspective difference between paintings. The findings contribute to the understanding of culture influence on people's aesthetic perception of visual art and visual communication.",

Similar to Treemap techniques, it uses enclosure to divide display space into smaller areas for its sub-hierarchies. The algorithm can partition a polygonal shape or even an arbitrary shape into smaller polygons, rotated rectangles or vertical-horizontal rectangles. The proposed method and implementation algorithms provide an effective interactive visualization tool for partitioning large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. We demonstrated the effective of the new method with a case study, an automated evaluation and a usability study.",

Recently geographic maps have been used as a metaphor for visualization, given that most people are familiar with reading maps, and several visualization methods based on this metaphor have been developed. In this paper we present a new visualization method that aims to improve on existing map-like visualizations. It is based on the metaphor of liquids poured onto a surface that expand outwards until they touch each other, forming larger areas. We present the design of our visualization method and an evaluation we have carried out to compare it with an existing visualization. Our new visualization has better usability, leading to higher accuracy and greater speed of task performance.",

Firstly, different views' features are extracted by unsupervised feature learning. Then classifiers are trained to evaluate each view's discrimination ability. A view with the best classifier has the best discrimination ability, and it is chosen as the best view of the 3D model. At last, experiments show that 3D models of same class have similar best views.",

    "abstract": "We deal in this paper with the problem of creating an interactive and visual map for a large collection of Open datasets. We first describe how to define a representation space for such data. We use text mining techniques to create features. Then, with a similarity measure between Open datasets, we use the Relative Neighbors method for building a proximity graph between datasets. We use a force-directed layout method to visualize the graph (Tulip Software). We present the results with a collection of 300,000 datasets from the French Open data web site, in which the display of the graph is limited to 150,000 datasets. We study the discovered clusters and we show how they can be used to browse this large collection.",

    "abstract": "With the growing importance of big data, and perhaps more significantly, the application of big data to the quantified self, it is more useful than ever for designers to be conversant with the wide range of measurements that can be obtained from various forms of instrumentation. When chairs can record and communicate details about sitting, sidewalks make suggestions about walking, and shavers monitor diet, interesting opportunities will arise for designers to generate new affordances based on the data. However, for many designers, the process of understanding the numbers available in the spreadsheets and databases may prove prohibitive, unless new methods are developed for showing relevance while not losing track of the underlying information. In this presentation, I propose a new genre of \"data stories,\" where the goal is to create narratives that are anchored in big data, but provide a form of shared experience that can be used to both shape design ideas and communicate their potential significance.",

However, it requires skills and time to hand craft high-quality, customized information graphics for specific situations (e.g., data characteristics and user tasks). The problem becomes more acute when we must deal with big data. To address this problem, we are researching and developing mixed-initiative visual analytic systems that leverage both the intelligence of humans and machines to aid users in deriving insights from massive data. On the one hand, such a system automatically guides users to perform their data analytic tasks by recommending suitable visualization and discovery paths in context. On the other hand, users interactively explore, verify, and improve visual analytic results, which in turn helps the system to learn from users' behavior and improve its quality over time. In this talk, I will present key technologies that we have developed in building mixed-initiative visual analytic systems, including feature-based visualization recommendation and optimization-based approaches to dynamic data transformation for more effective visualization. I will also use concrete applications to demonstrate the use and value of mixed-initiative visual analytic systems, and discuss existing challenges and future directions in this area.",

Interactive image database browsing systems provide an interesting alternative to retrieval-based approaches as they let the user explore an image dataset in an intuitive fashion. Based on content-based concepts, large image collections are visualised so that visually similar images are located close in the visualisation space. Once an image collection is displayed, the user is then given the opportunity to interactively explore it through various browsing operations. In my talk, I will highlight the three main approaches to visualising image databases, namely mapping-based, clustering-based and graph-based visualisations and will then present some of the systems that we have developed in our lab for this purpose, such as the Hue Sphere Image Browser, the Honeycomb Image Browser and their recent ports to large multi-touch screen environments and mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "The framework of Texture-by-numbers (TBN) synthesizes images of global-varying patterns with intuitive user control. Previous TBN synthesis methods have difficulties in achieving high-quality synthesis results and efficiency simultaneously. This paper proposes a fast TBN synthesis method based on texture optimization, which uses global optimization to solve the controllable non-homogeneous texture synthesis problem. Our algorithm produces high quality synthesis results by combining texture optimization into TBN framework with two improvements. The initialization process is adopted to generate the initial output of the global optimization algorithm, which speeds up the algorithm's convergence rate and ensures synthesis quality. Besides different metrics to measure image similarity are defined to match human visual perception better. To further improve the synthesis speed, the algorithm is entirely implemented on GPU based on CUDA architecture. The experimental results show that this method synthesizes realistic images with high efficiency, which is not only applicable to the traditional TBN application, but also suitable for other applications including non- photorealistic rendering and image in-painting.",

    "abstract": "Network security depends heavily on automated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to sense malicious activities. Unfortunately, IDS often generates both too much raw information and a large number of false positive alerts. Information visualization research has been performed to help users discover and analyze information through visual exploration efficiently. Even with the aid of visualization, identifying the attack patterns and recognizing the false positives from a great number of alerts are still challenges. In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework for IDS alerts that can monitor the network and perceive the overall view of the security situation using radial graph in real-time. The framework utilizes five categories of entropy functions to quantitatively analyze the irregular behavioral patterns, and synthesizes interactions, filtering and drill-down to detect the potential intrusions. In conclusion, we describe how this framework was used to analyze the mini-challenges of the 2011 and 2012 VAST challenge.",

The opinion mining methods proposed in the recent decade have formed a solid foundation to investigate the sentiment analysis tasks, but are often too complicated and scattered to serve the needs of real customers. We introduce the VISA system in this paper, which applies the visualization technology to synthesize the sentiment analysis results and present to the end user in an interactive manner. VISA builds on the generic sentiment tuple based data model and consumes the different facets of sentiment data with coordinated multiple views, hence is scalable to work with most of existing sentiment analysis engines on various application domains. We showcase the usage of VISA in a real world example and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through the user trail in finding an appropriate hotel for his family trip.",

But are there are other socioeconomic factors that influence disease incidence as well? In this paper, we introduce a visualization tool called Disease Trends that explores the associations and possible correlations between specific economic (personal income per capita), educational (percentage of adult population with a four year college degree), and environmental (air pollution level) factors with diabetes prevalence and cancer incidence rates across counties throughout the United States. It is structured as an interactive geographical visualization that displays disease incidence data as an interactive choropleth map and connects it with coordinated views of the socioeconomic variables for each county as the user scrolls over it. Additionally, the ability to compare and contrast counties as well as to interactively specify a region for comparison allows further examination of the data. This results in an informative overview of disease incidence trends that allows users to spot areas of interest and potentially pursue these areas further with more scientific research.",

Specifically, our approach extracts key data features as virtual words and uses them to encode various data properties. The distributions of virtual words across time are further applied to study various temporal relationships by generating time lines, which renders sampled time steps as points and temporal sequence as a line. Our approach consists of the three following components. First, we select feature points and collect feature descriptors to build a space of data properties, where virtual words are extracted as representative vectors. Second, the virtual words are applied to characterize feature points and their distribution statistics are used to measure temporal relationships. Third, we present several case studies to visualize time lines for different data visualization and analysis purposes. Our time line visualization can be used for both summarization and exploration of overall temporal relationships. We demonstrate with examples that time lines can serve as effective exploration, comparison, and visualization tools to study time-varying datasets.",

Artists use stitches of rich colors and apply different types of stitch categories from course to fine on multiple layers to express objects. This paper proposes an irregular needling embroidery rendering method based on image. We first decompose the image into different regions, vector fields and image detail information to guild the subsequent simulation process. Then we hierarchically render the image with a series of layers and propose a multilayer rendering technique. Additionally, we build a stitch dictionary and present a method to simulate the threads. Experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper transfers reference images quickly and efficiently into their irregular needling embroidery simulations.",

With the increasing complexity and volume of dynamic networks, it is important to adopt strategies of joint decision-making through developing collaborative visualization approaches. In this paper, we present a formal user study to evaluate how paired users collaborate under co-located and distributed collaboration environments to tackle the problems of intrusion detection. Ten paired participants are requested to use network visualization patterns to identify attacks existed in the datasets. We observe participants behaviors and collect their performances from the aspects of coordination and communication, which include prioritizing goals and directions, dividing and balancing workloads, and negotiating analysis decisions while maintaining situational awareness. Based on the results, we conclude several coordination strategies and summarize the values of communication for collaborative detection. We also discuss human-related factors in the process of joint decision-making. Our study provides useful information for future design and development of collaborative visualization systems.",

The initial Chinese UX Questionnaire was based on a widely used English questionnaire, AttracDiff, proposed and refined by Hassenzahl and his colleagues, but extended with an additional dimension and several new items received from the interviews of Chinese users. We also conducted a study of applying the initial questionnaire for accessing the user experience of interacting three different mobile phones involved with thirty-six Chinese participants. We applied both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis on the items with good item-total correlations. The result showed that three factors or dimensions were identified: Hedonic Quality (Stimulation), Pragmatic Quality, and Conformity, as compared to the four dimensions in the AttracDiff. This confirmed our initial hypothesis that cultures not only influence people's cognition, but also affect their experience of interacting with products. We also discuss the future steps for refining the Chinese UX Questionnaire.",

We focus on business analysts and asset managers, who work collaboratively to analyze information and make decisions. Through extensive investigations in two organizational environments, we found that these users struggle with managing and analyzing information from multiple perspectives. Their current tools lack support for aggregating, organizing, and sharing such information. To address their needs, we characterized their analytic workflows, extracted specific key knowledge actions for each task commonly found in these workflows, and designed and evaluated two visual analytics systems that support and encapsulate these knowledge actions. We provide design guidelines that should be used when designing visual analytics systems, and illustrate their effectiveness with two systems built by following them.",

The new representation makes it possible to switch back and forth between tables and parallel coordinates in smooth transformations. The authors have developed a tool that can manipulate these representations for the analysis of multidimensional data. Through experimental evaluation, the advantages of this tool are illustrated. It is expected that both the representation and the tool offer a significant improvement to the early stage of data analysis.",

These lead that the file system becomes more and more rough-and-tumble, to a certain extent putting users to trouble in daily work. This paper systematically analyzed the problems in file system management, put forward user cognitive model when faced with massive files, and then introduced the FDTVAS system which is a visual interface based on hyperbolic tree view for exploring the massive files. This system used specific algorithm to do the intelligent analysis of file relationship, took hyperbolic tree as the main visual form, and provided a series of interaction tasks according with users' cognitive model. The built system can help users get a clear insight of the file system and do the analysis and management efficiently.",

However, some basic questions concerning pen tilting behaviors, such as the ideal range, azimuth size, and direction of pen tilting, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we report our empirical studies on user performances in basic pen tilting tasks. First, we conducted a baseline study, which helps us to determine tilting directions, tilting ranges, and the thresholds that separate incidental pen tilting actions from intentional actions used for interaction. Based on the results from the baseline study, we designed an experiment to investigate user performances in goal tilting in different tilting ranges, azimuth sizes, and directions. Drawing on the results of our data analyses on task completion time, error rate, and pen tip movements, we discussed values of tilting parameters like titling range, minimal azimuth size, and tilting direction.",

We present here a formalisation of this class of languages, which we call Controlled Dataflow. This work was motivated by a previous study of an exceptions mechanism for visual languages of this type, since to define how the exceptions mechanism could be incorporated into any CDL, we needed a formalism to precisely capture the syntax and semantics of this class, including a protocol for including language-specific control structures. To illustrate the formalism, we provide an example that shows how it captures conditional execution and iteration. We also report on use of this formalism as the basis for an implementation of new CDL language tools.",

As a software visualization work, our approach is focused on both static structure of the Rete network and dynamic behavior of the inference process. Since logic programming is distinct from other traditional programming paradigms, our approach is also different from traditional program/algorithm visualization methods. In this paper, we first introduce the target we choose to visualize, and then provide a description of the problem and our visualization approach. Finally, with an implementation and an interesting case -- sudoku solving, we show that the visualization work is helpful to understanding not only the Rete algorithm, but also the rules used in the inference. Besides, our work supports debugging, tracing and analyzing the rule engine, which is useful in finding errors and optimization.",

In this visualization, the dimensions of data in n-dimensional space are mapped to n concentric circular axes drawn in a planar space with polar coordinates. A data item in n-dimensional space is represented as a poly-curve with n vertices across all circular axes. Via the spatial distortion in polar system, the view of multi-dimensional data is interactively adjusted to satisfy viewer's interest. The viewer, thus, can effectively navigate the underlying visual pattern to reach the great detail for uncovering trends and patterns in the visualization. One novelties of this work is performing focus+context viewing in polar coordinate system.",

    "abstract": "The large amount of phone call records from mobile operators in a city can inform us how many people are present in any given area and how many are entering or leaving. Each phone call record usually contains the caller and callee IDs, date and time, and the base station where the phone calls are made. As mobile phones are widely used in our daily life, many human behaviors can be revealed by analyzing mobile phone data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive visual analysis system which can be used to analyze the population's mobility patterns from millions of phone call records. Our system consists of three major components: 1) visual analysis of user groups in a base station; 2) visual analysis of the mobility patterns on different user groups making phone calls in certain base stations; 3) visual analysis of handoff phone call records. Some well-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and pixel-based representations have been integrated into our system. We also develop a novel visualization schemes, Voronoi-diagram-based visual encoding to reveal the unique features of mobile phone data. We have applied our system to real mobile phone data collected in a large city and obtained some interesting findings regarding people's mobility pattern.",

In this paper we present a novel fuzzy logic method to automatically generate the description of spatial relationships among objects. A new graph-based fuzzy linguistic metadata schema named Snowflake is proposed to describe the topology and metric relationships for a set of objects. Like an artist painting a picture, Snowflake selects one reference object to present the spatial relationships of all the other objects with respect to this reference object. This paper introduces the operations and isomorphism of Snowflake. The paper also demonstrates that Snowflake preserves the rotation invariance and the scale invariance of spatial relationships. Experiments show that Snowflake is an efficient and effective spatial modeling method.",

    "abstract": "Friend recommendation is popular in social network services to help people make new friends and expand their networks. Friend recommendation is either based on topological structures of a social network, or derived from profile information of users. However, dynamically recommending friends by considering both social connections and a context of social connections (e.g., similar interest) in a way of visual exploration is not well supported by existing tools. In this paper, we propose a novel visual system, SFViz (Social Friends Visualization), to support users to explore and find friends interactively under a context of interest. Our approach leverages both semantic structure of activity data and topological structures in social networks. In SFViz, a hierarchical structure of social tags is generated to help users navigate through a network of interest. Multiscale and cross-scale aggregations of similarity among people are presented in the hierarchy to support users to seek potential friends. We report a case study using SFViz to explore the recommended friends based on people's tagging behaviors in a music community, Last.fm. The results indicate that our system can enhance users' awareness of their social networks under different interest contexts, and help users seek potential friends sharing similar interests in an interactive way.",

For good and for ill, our professional, personal, and social activities are increasingly dependent on and intertwined with digital computation and communication facilities. Visual interfaces through which we typically interact with such systems date from Ivan Sutherland's seminal Sketchpad system in the 60's and now are commonplace on devices ranging from phones to ultrahigh resolution display walls. Interfaces continue to be a main focus of HCI and information visualization research and applications. In this talk I argue that focusing on the interface is only one of multiple important and necessary levels of design to support information-based activities and unless we attend more seriously to social, cognitive, and embodied levels, we will continue to fall far short of realizing the full potential of computer technology to aid thought, communication, and social interaction.",

Often, people open the linked document into a new tabbed window to which they return later. In such cases, users usually have many tabs opened.

    "abstract": "Streamline based method is one of the most important vector field visualization methods. In the past streamline placements algorithms, little physical related feature was considered, which is very important in our opinion. A novel streamline placement algorithm for 3D vector field is introduced in this paper. We measure the difference between the inflow and the outflow to evaluate the local spatial-varying feature at a specified field point. A Difference of Inflow and Outflow Matrix (DIOM) is then calculated to describe the global appearance of the field. We draw streamlines by choosing the local extreme points in DIOM as seeds. DIOM is somewhat like flow divergence and is physics-related thus re-flects intrinsic characteristics of the vector field. The strategy performs well in revealing features of the vector field even with relatively few streamlines both in 3D vector field",

However, the dataset of the training samples is so large and multi-dimensional that traditional techniques can't convey them effectively in a relative small display area. To address this problem, a parallel coordinates-based BP network visualization technique is proposed. In this approach, the parallel coordinates is constructed according to the model of BP neural network. In particular, clusters, colors, size, density and other features are used to improve the parallel coordinates to create clear intelligible visualization. At last, an experiment is designed to argue that parallel coordinates-based BP network visualization is feasible and effective, and can reveal the relations and rules hidden in the training samples in the process of the training.",

Then parallel coordinates with column-based cluster, bar axis density and other techniques is used to convey a large complex multi-dimensional dataset in a relative small screen through the following steps: (a) visualization of column-based clusters with user-defined granularity to simplify the corresponding dimension where we group all the data points into several discrete values; (b) several distinct colors to distinguish the lines contain different amount of data points; (c) opacity is introduced to visualization to tell the difference among the lines with the same color; (d) brand instead of polyline to reveal the centre and the extent of each cluster; (e) layer-based drawing technique to emphasize the heavy lines and to denote the trend of multi-dimensional datasets; (f) bar axis to provide special space to illustrate the density of the dataset on each axis. Anyway, our work has two primary goals: one is to convey large dataset with legible compact vivid visualization on a limited screen area. The other one is to simultaneously reveal as many information features as possible away from clutter.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has indicated that human graph reading performance can be affected by the size of crossing angle. Crossing angle is closely related to another aesthetic criterion: number of edge crossings. Although crossing number has been previously identified as the most important aesthetic, its relative impact on performance of human graph reading is unknown, compared to crossing angle. In this paper, we present an exploratory user study investigating the relative importance between crossing number and crossing angle. This study also aims to further examine the effects of crossing number and crossing angle not only on task performance measured as response time and accuracy, but also on cognitive load and visualization efficiency. The experimental results reinforce the previous findings of the effects of the two aesthetics on graph comprehension. The study demonstrates that on average these two closely related aesthetics together explain 33% of variance in the four usability measures: time, accuracy, mental effort and visualization efficiency, with about 38% of the explained variance being attributed to the crossing angle.",

We present an algorithm for semantic comparison of programs in controlled visual dataflow languages; that is, languages in which dataflow diagrams are embedded in control structures. This algorithm performs depth-first search of call structures comparing embedded diagrams using subgraph isomorphism, to determine if two programs are semantically equivalent, and if they are not, discovers the differences. We use the visual language Prograph for illustration; however, the mechanism we propose could be applied to any controlled dataflow language, such as LabVIEW.",

In this paper, we present the framework for creating and modifying a concept map that allows analysts to collaborate and utilize live collection of enterprise data in a visual interface. Based on modeling users and tasks in visual analysis, a user model supporting collaborative analysis is given. Furthermore, we propose the algorithm of concept map layout to facilitate the visual analysis. The interface presents the analyst with the dashboard configuration of certain data that users deems relevant, provides tools to facilitate the decision making process. Finally, we apply it to a collaborative visual decision support system. Experimental results show that it enhances the accessibility and the individualization of collaborative concept map for configuring enterprise data and helps to enhance user experience during the visual analysis process.",

One of such resources is a set of discourse strategies, the abstract structures that specify how to construct a coherent text to achieve a specific communicative goal. Discourse strategies, however, prove to be difficult to develop, in part due to their abstractness. In this paper, we describe a graphical tool which allows users to annotate documents to indicate its various elements and how they relate to each other. The annotations can then be used to generate a first draft of the discourse strategies automatically. The tool is presented in the context of the Myriad delivery platform which aims at facilitating the rapid development of tailored information delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Social tags reflect personal and shared vocabulary, and provide opportunities for people to organize and search information. However, tags are usually not structured. To find relevant tags and associated documents, people often need to invest significant amount of cognitive resources to make sense of the relationships among tags. To help the sensemaking of social tags and exploration of knowledge structure of them, we propose an approach of tag networks, TagNet, in which tags are linked by their corresponding documents and a multiscale tag hierarchy are derived with network clustering and aggregation techniques. We also present TagNetLens, an interactive tool that allows users to explore a tag network and its tag hierarchy. We report a case study of TagNet and TagNetLens based on social tags and documents from CiteULike. The results indicate that our TagNet approach can provide users with knowledge structures that are similar to cognitive structures of concepts in people's minds, and TagNetLens can help people to better explore the space of social tags and may have potentials to facilitate the understanding of the knowledge structure in social tags.",

Effective and efficient search on the web is a key challenge. In this paper we propose a system for web search based on the visual structure (layout and colors) of web pages. Considering that interpretation of visual structures depends on individual perceptual characteristics, the creator and the searcher both participate in a session of expressing their own interpretation of layout and colors of a target web page. Web search is carried out by evaluating similarities between those visual page structures. This search scheme will help people to organize richer social networks with consideration of user's sensibility and preference to visual structural features.",

    "abstract": "Crime specific event patterns are crucial in detecting potential relationships among suspects in criminal networks. However, current link analysis tools commonly used in detection do not utilize such patterns for detecting various types of crimes. These analysis tools usually provide generic functions for all types of crimes and heavily rely on the user's expertise on the domain knowledge of the crime for successful detection. As a result, they are less effective in detecting patterns in certain crimes. In addition, substantial effort is also required for analyzing vast amount of crime data and visualizing the structural views of the entire criminal network. In order to alleviate these problems, an event-based approach to money laundering data analysis and visualization is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a money laundering case from Taiwan.",

Mobil applications place special constraints that challenge the existing ways of visual analytic design where relatively stable and interaction-rich contexts are assumed. In tasks like learning unfamiliar places, current visualizations on mobile devices are not capable of helping users to form a good cognitive map of the environment. How can we take advantage of rich physical environmental cues and supplement with computational power to help people make sense of the environment? In this paper, we present a framework of sensemaking to model how people get insight into the environment as they navigate around. Based on this framework, we present design guidelines for mobile visual analytics that could enhance the spatial awareness of the navigator and analyze several existing designs through the discussion.",
