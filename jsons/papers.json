    "abstract": "A common enhancement of scatterplots represents points as small multiples, glyphs, or thumbnail images. As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.",

Various metrics for evaluating scatterplots, such as scagnostics, have been devised and applied to scatterplot selection. This paper presents a new scatterplot selection technique that applies multiple metrics. First, the technique calculates the scores of scatterplots with multiple metrics and then constructs a graph by connecting similar scatterplots. Next, it uses a graph coloring algorithm to assign different colors to similar scatterplots. We can extract a set of various scatterplots by selecting them that the specific same color is assigned. This paper introduces a visualization example with a retail dataset containing multidimensional climate and sales values.",

Small-sized factories intend to take full advantage of the data collected by sensors used in their machinery. The ultimate goal is to minimize cost and maximize quality, resulting in an increase in profit. In collaboration with domain experts, we implemented a data visualization tool to enable decision-makers in a plastic factory to improve their production process. We investigate three different aspects: methods for preprocessing multivariate time series data, clustering approaches for the already refined data, and visualization techniques that aid domain experts in gaining insights into the different stages of the production process. Here we present our ongoing results grounded in a human-centered development process. We adopt a formative evaluation approach to continuously upgrade our dashboard design that eventually meets partners’ requirements and follows the best practices within the field.",

    "abstract": "Immersive analytics is a fast growing field that is often applied in virtual reality (VR). VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality.",

Changes in height, color, and area of individual nodes can easily be visualized using animated transitions.

We show how procedural texture patterns can be superimposed to the color mapping and support transitions. To this end, we discuss qualitative properties of each pattern, demonstrate their ability to communicate change direction both with and without animation, and conclude which of the patterns are more likely to increase effectiveness and correctness of the change mapping in 2.5D treemaps.",

    "abstract": "Eye movements are closely related to the cognitive processes and often act as a window to the brain and mind. To facilitate a window to the brain using eye movements, we propose EyeFIX, an interactive visual analytics interface. Our interface currently focuses on processing gaze movements to generate the two most prominent events, fixations, and saccades which are used in a large part of the eye movement literature. Our interface has multiple interactive widgets that allow the users to choose the algorithm and tune its hyper parameters that control how fixations and saccades are generated. It has four major visualizations: (1) A Gaze Plot to showcase the gaze movement of each participant, (2) a Fixation Plot that helps to identify regions of the stimulus which are of interest to a particular participant, (3) a Heat Map to study the denser regions of fixation and regions which the participant frequently visited, and (4) a Timeline Visualization to assist in having a closer look at temporal regions of interest. We design a set of brushing and linking operators that allow users to interactively control all the visualizations to dig deeper in both, the spatial and temporal domains. We demonstrate the applicability of our interface with datasets obtained by human subjects viewing naturalistic stimuli while performing various viewing tasks, including visual exploration, visual search, and prolonged visual fixation.",

    "abstract": "There is recent work in applying concepts from discourse analysis to comics in order to formalise visual content across comics sequences, however much of this work lacks empirical verification. We address this gap by assessing inter-annotator agreement on a preliminary annotation scheme for segmenting areas of comic pages, and assigning referents or classifications to these segmentations. A browser-based annotation tool and inter-annotator agreement measures are introduced. We find high agreement for segmentation tasks, while reference tasks show adequate agreement as well as instructive disagreements showing constraints on reader interpretation.",

    "abstract": "The multivariate Spatio-Temporal data challenges the analysts along the navigation and exploration of the information, using Data Analytics techniques. We present SPLORT, as a user-centered web-based solution for segmented Visual Analytics. The tool involves a “What-Where-When” pyramidal paradigm to drive Spatio-temporal analysis towards the findings of new insights. It features multi-layered coordinated views to help the analyst navigate and explore multivariate data simultaneously. We evaluated this web-based tool, and reported the findings and results, considering users’ performance and perceptions, basing our analysis on their Likert scale (0-5) responses, regarding their experience and the tool's usability, and the sentiment of their feedback, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our findings from the pilot study held, suggest that SPLORT successfully allows the users to visually query, explore and analyze contextless multi-scale attributes within space and time, which quickly drives them to new insights and to support easier decision-making processes. Moreover, the tool's flexibility, due to its multi-layered GUI, supports better and more friendly visual analytics.",

    "abstract": "Comprehending and exploring large and complex data is becoming increasingly important for a diverse population of users in a wide range of application domains. Visualization has proven to be well-suited in supporting this endeavor by tapping into the power of human visual perception. However, non-experts in the field of visual analysis often have difficulties in correctly reading and interpreting information from novel visualization idioms. Visualization onboarding can support novices in learning how to use new digital technologies. Therefore, we developed an interactive step-by-step guide and applied the method to four visualization techniques—a bar chart, a horizon graph, a change matrix, and a parallel coordinates plot. Results using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers show that there is a need for onboarding, especially for more complex visualization techniques. We further investigated the perception and rating of a scrollytelling and a video tutorial for the most unfamiliar visualization—the parallel coordinates plot. A comparison between the three onboarding methods indicates that participants appreciated the easy-to-understand examples, the precise wording of the onboarding messages in a step-by-step manner, and the introduction of interaction concepts by highlighting the most relevant information over all onboarding methods. The video tutorial supported the introduction of unknown interaction techniques best.",

Visualization of such datasets is not an easy task since they are complex and often huge. Immersive Analytics is a powerful approach to support the interactive exploration of such large and complex data. Many recent studies on graph visualization have applied immersive analytics frameworks; however, there have been few studies on immersive analytics for visualization of multidimensional attributes associated with the input graphs. This paper presents a new immersive analytics system that supports the interactive exploration of multidimensional feature values assigned to the nodes of input graphs. The presented system displays ”label-axes” corresponding to the dimensions of feature values, and ”label-edges” that connect label-axes and corresponding to the nodes. The system supports visual linking operations which controls the display of edges that connect a label-axis and nodes of the graph. This paper introduces visualization examples with a graph dataset of Twitter users and reviews by experts on graph data analysis.",

In this paper, we present an approach that combines statistical profiling, clustering and visualization to facilitate this task. We implemented our approach in a tool which is integrated as a plugin into a widely used IDE. First, we introduce our approach with details on the profiling and clustering strategy that produce runtime metrics and clusters of threads for source-code artifacts at different levels of abstraction (class and method) and the entire program. Next, we explain the design of our sparkline visualization which represents the clusters in situ, i.e. embedded in the program text next to the related source-code artifact in the source-code editor. More detailed information is available in separate views that also allow the user to interactively configure thread filters. In a demonstration study we illustrate the usefulness of the tool for understanding and fixing performance and concurrency issues. Finally, we report on first formative results from a small-scale user study.",

    "abstract": "Exploratory search starts with ill-defined goals and involves browsing, learning, and formulating new targets for search. To fluidly support such dynamic search behaviours, we focus on devising interactive visual facets (IVF), visualising information facets to support user comprehension and control of the information space. To do this, we reviewed existing faceted search interfaces and derived two design requirements (DR) that have not been fully addressed to support fluid interactions in exploratory search. We then exemplified the requirements through devising an IVF tool, which coordinates a linear and a categorical facet representing the distribution and summarisation of items, respectively, and providing context for faceted exploration (DR1). To support rapid transitions between search criteria (DR2), the tool introduces a novel design concept of using facets to select items without filtering the item space. Particularly, we propose a filter-swipe technique that enables users to drag a categorical facet value sequentially over linear facet bars to view the items in the intersection of the two facets along with the categorical facet dynamically summarizing the items in the interaction. A user study of 11 participants with realistic email search tasks shows that dynamic suggestions through the timeline navigation can help discover useful suggestions for search; the novel design concept was favoured over using facet values as filters. Based on these practices, we derive IVF design implications for fluid, exploratory searches.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe a visualization tool for representing the dynamics of graph algorithms. Toward this end, we designed a web-based framework which illustrates the dynamics as time-to-space mappings of dynamic graphs. Such static diagrams of dynamic data have the benefit of being able to display longer time spans in one view, hence supporting the observer with comparison tasks. The tool can show details about how an algorithm traverses a graph step-by-step in a static and animated fashion, for graph algorithm exploration as well as educational purposes. The animation together with the time-to-space mapping forms an overview-and-detail approach. By using flight carrier data from the U.S. Department of Transportation we show the usefulness of our interactive visualization for conveying graph algorithm dynamics.",

For these and other reasons, email has become a source of stress; pushing us apart rather than bringing us together. In this paper, we describe POEM (People-Oriented EMail), a prototype email client designed to restore and strengthen email’s socially connective role. Because much of human communication is non-verbal, POEM features a visualization that summarizes user’s inbox by correspondent, using their profile pictures. To highlight human relationships, POEM offers access to detailed correspondent messages only by clicking on their pictures. Encouraging deeper relationships, POEM organizes correspondents by social importance measures including communication effort, balance, and delay before response. We conclude by sketching our plans to evaluate POEM.",

They contain a wealth of information about the opinions and experiences of users, which help better understand consumer decisions and improve products and services. However, the huge volume of reviews makes it difficult for potential customers to gain useful insights and for managers to track customer opinions. To address these problems, we first use topic modeling techniques for customer opinion mining. Then, we build a deep learning network for sentiment analysis. Finally, we perform sentiment analysis of the reviews at the aspect level to obtain the sentiment vector representation of the accommodation. Moreover, we design a visual analytic system with a user-friendly interface to facilitate interactive analysis. Evaluation including user and case studies demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of this system.",

In order for the fluid solution to be stable, we take a more reliable surface particles detection method in the solver. On this basis, instead of computing implicit function from all fluid particles, we only use surface particles by means of SPR. In order to build a smoother, feature-preserved surface, we adapt a fluid particles pre-processing pipeline to compensate for the defects of fluid particles applied to SPR. In experiment, we demonstrate how the SPR can benefit from our pre-processing pipeline and a significant improvement in quality of reconstructed surfaces as compared to existing methods.",

In this paper we describe a visual analysis tool that takes into account a multitude of educational data sources, filters those into the most relevant ones, and derives attributes-of-interest which form a high-dimensional dataset. For this data we apply t-SNE as one possible projection method to visualize and uncover similarities and dissimilarities among the high-dimensional attributes in a lower-dimensional space like in a scatter plot. We also support interaction techniques and further visual variables to encode additional data attributes in the form of color codings, sizes, and shapes.

In order to confidently know when and how treemaps can best be applied, the research community uses usability studies and controlled experiments to \"understand the potential and limitations of our tools\" (Plaisant, 2004). To support the communities' understanding and usage of treemaps, this survey provides a comprehensive review and detailed overview of 69 user studies related to treemaps. However, due to pitfalls and shortcomings in design, conduct, and reporting of the user studies, there is little that can be reliably derived or accepted as a generalized statement. Fundamental open questions include configuration, compatible tasks, use cases, and perceptional characteristics of treemaps. The reliability of findings and statements is discussed and common pitfalls of treemap user studies are identified.",

The tool provides ways to upload, share, explore, and compare hierarchical data using a multitude of different linked hierarchy visualizations. The current version supports up to 8 hierarchy visualizations, with the space-reclaiming icicle plots among them. Several of the visualizations can be shown in linked views while typical hierarchy parameters and visual variables can be changed on user demand. The interactive tool makes use of OpenGL and Angular, an industry standard JavaScript platform, and runs in a web browser. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to the NCBI taxonomy that consists of more than 300,000 hierarchically organized species while filtering for the tetrapoda subhierarchy. Finally, we explain implementation details and discuss limitations and scalability issues of the linked visualization techniques.",

However, due to the sparseness of record data and the difference in service regions, the relationship between them is indeed obscure, and previous solutions mostly focus only on a single system. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics system to investigate the similarities and differences between bike-sharing and taxi systems. The service region for each bike station is created to fuse bike-sharing data and taxi data. We harness two 3-order tensors to represent them in a unified framework to generate potential patterns by tensor decomposition. The visual analytics system integrates two spatiotemporal data sources by analyzing the patterns that are typical of each data source and the patterns that are common to both data sources to assist users in better discovering the relationships between the taxi system and the bike-sharing system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through real-world case studies.",

Understanding the users' travel behavior is invaluable for policy makers and related companies. However, it is difficult to capture the spatio-temporal cycling patterns based on sparse bike-sharing data. In this paper, we analyze the dockless bike-sharing data using tensor decomposition method. A three-dimensional tensor is constructed first, and a tensor decomposition method is employed to detect the underlying travel patterns. Several visual components are designed to show the extracted patterns. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

For example, physical growth data for age 7-18 has been collected every a few months for up to seven years; therefore, only short growth pattern pieces exist in the data. When using previous prediction techniques, it is challenging to create a growth prediction model that reflects individual growth patterns. Also, uncertainties in predicted results emerge since the overall trend of the data is unknown. In this work, we present a predictive analysis and modeling to forecast incomplete data over time. We extend the Bayesian network model, which is relative data-driven approaches that explore similar data and weave them to create approximate inference margins. Besides, we propose a visual analytics system that enables us to design various predictive models that reflect individual growth pattern. Our visual analytics system assists us to discover new growth patterns in the process of analyzing the accuracy of previously designed predictive models. Moreover, the system allows us to optimize predictive models to fit unusual growth patterns.",

Epidemiologists have to analyze this epidemiological data on a regular basis. They use this spatio-temporal information, most of which is shared online, to detect, observe, and track geographic locations of disease outbreaks over time. Unfortunately, manually retrieving the data from a website like Google News and then deriving sensible insights from the huge dataset consumes a lot of time and effort. We present EpidNews, a new visual analytics tool that helps to visualize and explore epidemiological news data for animals. The tool uses several views depicting various levels of abstraction, which helps fulfill almost all the data analysis requirements of epidemiologists. We also present the case study of an epidemiology expert, wherein she assesses the usability and productivity of EpidNews by using the tool in her daily work.",

    "abstract": "Effective visualisation plays a vital role in generating insights from data. The selection of graph types however, is highly dependent on the analysis tasks and data types at hand. For example, spatio-temporal visualisations encode changes in data over time and space. Although they have the potential of revealing overall tendencies and movement patterns, building effective spatio-temporal visualisations is challenging because it requires encoding all three attributes of spatio-temporal data i.e. thematic (values of attributes), temporal and spatial in a single visualisation. In this application design study, we present PedaViz for representing hour-level spatio-temporal attributes within a single visualisation; a 24-hour radial visual metaphor that encodes hour-level temporal and daily temperature attributes while utilising a thematic map display to present spatial attributes. The design was applied on city planning domain using Melbourne's pedestrian count and temperature data. Results of our preliminary user evaluation suggest that our visualisation is easily understandable by users; and supports users in carrying out selected analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "Visualization of customer behavior is urgently needed for an increasing number of customer orders on O2O (online to offline) platform. Although many works have been done on visualizing customer opinion or customer click events of one store, visualizing customer switching behavior among stores is still challenging. The challenge is to show customer order records over time and structure the inter-connection among different stores when customer switching behavior happens. In this work, we focus on Takeout O2O service to present a novel visual analysis system for retailers focusing on customer switching behavior patterns. Firstly we define five customer segments based on switching behavior. Then this system enables temporal-spatial driver exploration for different segments through several interactive views. Moreover, in order to visualize inter-connection sequences, augmented streamgraph with the bundled parallel coordinates is proposed as one alternative technique to visualize temporal event sequences. Case studies through collaboration with domain experts also demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this system in helping customer relationship management.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an image-space contrast enhancement method for color-encoded visualization. The contrast of an image is enhanced through a perceptually-guided approach that interfaces with the user with a single and intuitive parameter of the virtual viewing distance. To this end, we analyze a multiscale contrast model of the input image and test the visibility of bandpass images of all scales at a virtual viewing distance. By adapting weights of bandpass images with a threshold model of spatial vision, this image-based method enhances contrast to compensate for contrast loss caused by viewing the image at a certain distance. Relevant features in the color image can be further emphasized by the user using overcompensation. The method is efficient and can be integrated into any visualization tool as it is a generic image-based post-processing technique. Using highly diverse datasets, we show the usefulness of perception compensation across a wide range of typical visualizations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we take a look into typical interaction scenarios when it comes to visualizing hierarchical data while we particularly focus on one specific candidate that is the visual depiction by generalized Pythagoras trees. Those are visualizations that benefit from their aesthetically appealing appearance since they come close to a visual model of trees growing in nature. Traditionally, those generalized Pythagoras trees are visualized on typical computer screens, clearly indicating the hierarchy, but negatively, the finer substructures are oftentimes not visible anymore due to the display space restriction and the low resolution. Hence, in this paper we describe the generalized Pythagoras trees displayed on largescale high-resolution displays and illustrate the challenges and perspectives when we have to interact with the visual representation by using the technique individually, but also in collaboration. To explore possible interactions we experimented with tablet computers combined with an optical tracking system. We evaluate the effectiveness and aesthetics by means of several modifiable visual parameters and by interacting with the visualization.",

    "abstract": "Shape grammars are powerful in specifying and generating an infinite number of designs by repeatedly applying predefined transformation rules to initial shapes. However, the intractable nature of shape grammars limits its wide use in many applications. Moreover, shape grammars lack a parsing method to automatically validate generated designs. In this paper, we present an approach capable of generating tractable designs and validating generated designs. Our approach transforms polygonal shapes and shape rules in shape grammars to graphs and then uses the spatial graph grammar (SGG) formalism to generate and parse designs. We have evaluated our approach by transforming shapes and shape rules originally specified in a shape grammar for Turkish houses to our graph representation and validating designs with the transformed graph rules on VEGGIE, a graph grammar specification and induction tool. Other shape grammars can be potentially integrated with our approach to extend their capability in generating and validating designs.",

On the other hand, such a move poses many difficulties, one of which is how to arrange content in a 3D space. This task becomes further complicated when the story-graph of the presentation is evolving and is more complex than a single linear story-path. In this work, we propose a framework for automatically solving the task of 3D content placement, which is based on views --- 3D replacement for slides. We also examplify our proposed approach with two spatial layouts for 3D non-linear presentations: \"nested spheres\" and a 'building', as well as algorithms that automatically create these layouts from an abstract hierarchical story-graph.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing and visualizing call relations can provide useful insights into the connectivities and linkings of certain parts of a software system. This can in particular be a good strategy to find software system parts that are interlinked a lot while others typically occur as more or less stand-alone components not called by many others. The challenging problem with call relation data comes from the dynamics of the data, i.e., a call graph can be changing either during the development of a software system or during the execution of the software. The second case mostly leads to long graph sequences changing on a fine-granular temporal scale requiring a suitable overview-based dynamic graph visualization technique. Moreover, identifying certain temporal patterns in the graph evolution can help to detect certain phases of either the evolution of a software system or phases during the execution that can show which components are connected while someone interacts with the runnable software for example. This can particularly be based on graph, layout, or attribute properties, all providing different perspectives on the dynamics of the graph data. We illustrate the usefulness of our visualization technique by applying it to the open source software project JHotDraw. The call graphs are recorded during runtime while typical user interactions are applied.",

    "abstract": "The Internet is constantly evolving and changing over time. Outages, attacks, upgrades, censorships, and policy changes modify the routing very frequently everywhere in the world. To give the possibility to the Internet Service Providers and to the network operators of monitoring such an evolving scenario, many organizations collect the routing changes and give free access to them. We propose, prototype, and evaluate a visual interface, called Upstream Visibility, to display such data. It is based on three views: (1) a global view that, based on stacked area charts, gives the high level trend of the visibility of an IP prefix; (2) a local view allows the user to check the effects over time of the visibility of an IP prefix on specific locations of the network; and (3) a traditional graph animation view. Also, we propose heuristics for producing such type of drawings, evaluating their effectiveness and performance against scenarios describing well-known Internet incidents.",

    "abstract": "Lots of movies are produced every year, too many to watch all of them and in particular, to get an overview about the evolution of typical movie genres and actors playing in them. Moreover, it is a challenging problem to detect correlations among the movies and the actors in those movies, in particular, if we are interested in time-varying data patterns like trends, countertrends, or anomalies and outliers. Those correlations are specifically interesting if they can be inspected on different levels of granularity, e.g., temporal, but also hierarchical in form of country- or continent-based correlations. In this paper we describe the IMDb Explorer, a web-based visualization tool that consists of two major views denoted by the movie cosmos and the career lines. Both views are linked and interactively manipulable while a list of user-defined metrics are explorable. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to the entire movie database provided by IMDb.",

Opinions, stances, arguments, topics, terms, and text documents are usually connected with many-to-many relationships for such tasks. Exploratory visual analysis with interactive tools can help the analysts to get an overview of the topics and opinions, identify particularly interesting documents, and describe main themes of various arguments. In our previous work, we introduced an interactive tool called Topics2Themes that was used for topic and theme analysis of vaccination-related discussion texts with a limited set of stance categories. In this poster paper, we describe an application of Topics2Themes to a different genre of data, namely, political comments from Reddit, and multiple sentiment and stance categories detected with automatic classifiers.",

Thus, it is important to explore how e-health related information is generated and disseminated in these platforms. The aim of our current efforts is to investigate the content and flow of information when people in Sweden use Twitter to talk about diabetes related issues. To achieve our goals, we have used data mining and visualization techniques in order to explore, analyze and cluster Twitter data we have collected during a period of 10 months. Our initial results indicate that patients use Twitter to share diabetes related information and to communicate about their disease as an alternative way that complements the traditional channels used by health care professionals.",

    "abstract": "Due to the continuous increase in the scale of numerical simulations, research on visualization has shifted to in-situ/in-transit approaches. The interactivity of largescale visualization has also become increasingly important. In order to observe largescale visualization data in detail, high-resolution displays, such as those with 8K or 16K resolutions, give an opportunity to inspire new discovery. With the commoditization of high-resolution displays, tiled display walls (TDWs) have facilitated their use for the collaborative research, where a large screen size is required for sharing the content among multiple sites. In this paper, we propose a remote collaboration method that utilizes a TDW driver (ChOWDER), which enables content sharing among multiple sites even with different display configurations, and a visualization application (HIVE) for dynamic content sharing of interactive visualization results.",

    "abstract": "Fashion styles often change over time, but why and how certain fashion clothes become out of style is rarely investigated. Researchers have long been interested in understanding why and how some fashion styles last long, while others are short lived. Our research demonstrates that the adoption speed affects fashion evolution. We analyze data obtained from the VOGUE magazine on clothes' frequency of appearance. Results show that cloth styles adopted quickly would become unfashionable faster. This may help understanding fashion consumption and thus guide the marketing effort.",

    "abstract": "Using predictive models for data-driven optimization of production lines is a trending topic in manufacturing. A challenge is to support the visualization and management of data and arising uncertainties in various phases. Modern production lines can contain thousands of sensors to collect readings every few milliseconds. When creating predictive models for optimization from this data, its sheer amount not only poses challenges to data storage and management, but also during the different phases of data preparation, modeling, decision making, and executing optimizations. Our research aims at a better support of all these phases with data visualization, with new strategies for the management of uncertainty. Predictive models help operators to identify problems and the degree of wear of tools or parts in production lines. However, data analysts, supervisors, and service technicians must be aware that these models contain uncertainties and the recommendations made by these models should be critically reflected before acceptance. One way to mitigate the negative impact of uncertainties is to use visualization as tool for analyzing the potentials and limits of prediction models. Therefore, we propose a process model for the different activities of optimization in a smart production environment and discuss challenges for the visualization of data and uncertainty in each step.",

However, fuzzy clustering results will become complex and high-dimensional membership degree matrixes when they contain a large number of data points and multiple clusters. In this paper, we propose a Radviz-based interactive visualization to help users understand fuzzy clustering results. Firstly, we utilize the projection mechanism of Radviz to map the membership degree matrixes onto planar and radial pictures, in which data points with low membership uncertainty are located near Radviz circumference, while the others are scattered in the center of Radviz circle. To provide an informative interactive visualization, we then improve traditional Radviz visualization in many aspects, including implementing an optimal and uneven placement of dimension anchors by using the Prim algorithm, designing visual codings of data points and dimension arcs to express statistical information, combining chord diagram to depict the sharing relationship between clusters, and offering a set of interactions to support deeper exploration. Finally, we use a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our visualization.",

Efficient parsing mechanisms are essential to these formalisms. However, the existent parsing algorithms are either inefficient or confined to a minority of graph grammars. This paper introduces the notion of partial precedence, defines the partial precedence graph of a graph grammar and theoretically unveils the existence of a valid parsing path conforming to the topological orderings of the partial precedence graph. Then, it provides algorithms for computing the partial precedence graph and presents an approach to improving general parsing algorithms with the graph based on the drawn conclusion. It is shown that the approach can considerably improve the efficiency of general parsing algorithms.",

But when dealing with large-scale data, there is room for improvement with regard to three issues: insufficient memory space, large time consumption and weak data expression. Therefore, this paper introduces the idea of cluster analysis to the storyline to present the clustering information and reduce the time complexity under the condition where a large number of entities interact in the same period. Meantime a scalable, reusable visualization library of storyline is implemented including some novel interactions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, people can do most of their personal tasks, such as banking on smart devices like personal computers (PCs). Especially, Malware targeted at personal information stored on mobile are hard to detect and risks from usage patterns are even more difficult. Therefore, a means for easy recognition of the problems and the smartphone usage is necessary. In this paper, we present a personal visual analytics (PVA) system for Android security risk lifelog using app permissions to recognize the risk. Our system stores the security-related personal information on the smartphone device and utilizes it to analyze the security risk lifelog. For the risk analysis, we define security risk scores based on the app and permission statistics. Then, several linked visualizations are designed to present the risk lifelog. We have collected the security lifelog data from eight Android smartphone users and analyzed their security matters. Our PVA system enables Android smartphone users to observe, mitigate the security risk, and eventually understand how Android security risk affects their lives. Moreover, we present a user study to evaluate the PVA system with user feedback.",

One example is the visualization of the energy output of power plants. We present a web-based application that aims to provide information about the energy production of a specified region, along with location information about the power plants. The application is intended to be used as a solid data basis for political discussions, nudging, and story telling about the German energy transition to renewables, called \"Energiewende\". It was therefore designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and provide information for a broad spectrum of users that do not need any domain-specific knowledge. Users are able to select different categories of power plants and look up their positions on an overview map. Glyphs indicate their exact positions and a selection mechanism allows users to compare the power output on different time scales using stacked area charts or ThemeRivers. As an evaluation of the application, we have collected web access statistics and conducted an online survey with respect to the intuitiveness, usability, and informativeness.",

    "abstract": "Following recent advances in visual interfaces for search, we investigate how to visualize activity traces to support collaborative information-seeking. We implemented a prototype system that visualizes traces of three types of activities (queries typed, articles bookmarked, and interested keywords) on top of a recent visual search system. The current interface of the system provides an interactive keyword visualization to support exploratory search. We designed two icons to visualize user interactions with the keywords and articles. We also implemented a time line to explicitly display the issued queries and additional details about the interactions. We conducted a longitudinal user study to evaluate the usability of these visualizations. We found that the visualization of traces of issued queries and bookmarked articles help the users to better monitor the progress of the collaborators, increase collaboration, and reassure their findings. Traces of interested keywords support sub-topic identification. Furthermore, activity traces of collaborators help the users to learn about the system features. The findings and the novel collaborative system provide valuable insights and tools into future research on designing interfaces for collaborative information-seeking.",

While in time series analysis many established methods require data that are sampled in regular time intervals, in practice sensors may sample data at varying interval lengths. Time series rastering is the process of aggregating unequally spaced time series into equal interval lengths. In this paper we discuss critical aspects in the context of time series rastering, and we present a visual design which supports the parametrization of the rastering transformation, communicates the introduced uncertainties and quality issues, and facilitates the comparison of alternative rastering outcomes to achieve optimal results.",

To exploit machine learning techniques for detecting anomaly status, we should prepare suitable models to express the statuses of moving objects in advance. In this paper, several variations of vector models are introduced. These vector models express the relative trajectories of two moving objects approaching each other. To investigate the features of the vector models, the authors tried to observe them by using panel matrices. By means of visualizations using a panel matrix, we can easily grasp the dependence of vector models to parameters and the similarity among variations of the models.",

The traditional Stock Chart provides limited information to investors as it only displays the price changes of the stock over a period of time. More information could be incorporated in the plot such as the return of a stock, the risk of a stock and the performance of the corporation issuing the stock. Based on the information what an investor concerns most about investment activities, a new style visualization method based on Parallel Coordinates is proposed.

    "abstract": "Apriori Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a popular data mining technique for deriving association rules from frequent itemsets, and it has a long history. Despite of its popularity, its performance suffers from a bottleneck in scalability. Many attempts were made in the past, including changing the frequent item database structure to sophisticated parallel execution. In this paper an alternative strategy is proposed which centred on segmenting the database in lieu of using the full database. The segmentation is by ensemble method which sifts and selects the most effective clustering algorithm; the resultant segmented data cluster is subsequently used for ARM. Using only a fraction of data transactions which supposedly has a high concentration of expressive data, ARM produces higher quality association rules at shorter time. The proposed ARM model is tested using three cases - bank, homicide and lung cancer. The results confirm the usefulness of this new model - higher quality rules are gained",

A gene co-expression network is created by computing the correlation between each gene pair in a gene-set. We transform the networks into scale-free networks in order to calculate the dissimilarity weights that are used to create our profiles. Our approach further distinguishes between gene pairs consisting of both, one, or no statistically significant genes. We find that the shapes and density of the profiles provide useful information for identification of disease gene biomarkers. Our results provide a means of visualizing the overall distribution of gene dissimilarity for each gene-set, as well as how gene dissimilarity is linked to the mutual significance of gene pairs within a gene-set.",

This machine learning-based approach can provide extracted useful information from large body of texts, in a reasonable time. However, the results are usually in complicated forms, which meant it is a non-trivial task in term of interpretation. In this paper, we present appropriate visualizations and analyses in order to tackle the tangled network representing relationship between entities (i.e. terms extracted from raw text). Conducted on a case study of information extraction in the business management domain, our results reveal the hidden relationships of inter-organizational success factors in a simple structured way.

    "abstract": "We present a preliminary design study for utilizing eye tracking to support interacting with a multi-document visualization. Complex information seeking tasks can involve collection and comparison of multiple documents, resulting in long and sustained search sessions. The sustained and evolving nature of the session also provides the search interface the opportunity to gather information on the user state and interaction history, which can be used to adapt the information content and representation. We designed a system to evaluate how eye tracking information can be used for adapting the visual salience of information entities. The interface features documents and related keywords that are arranged in a radial layout configuration called the intent radar. Reading history and visual attention, as registered by eye tracking data, are respectively used to trace read items and for visual cueing. We evaluated the interface with 16 participants to gather subjective feedback about specific components and features of the interface. The overall results show that the interface and gaze-related appearance of keywords was positively received by the users.",

    "abstract": "The mandala thangka, as a religious art in Tibetan Buddhism, is an invaluable cultural and artistic heritage. However, drawing a mandala is both time and effort consuming and requires mastery skills due to its intricate details. Retaining and digitizing this heritage is an unresolved research challenge to date. In this paper, we propose a computer-aided generation approach of mandala thangka patterns to address this issue. Specifically, we construct parameterized models of three stylistic patterns used in the interior mandalas of Nyingma school in Tibetan Buddhism according to their geometric features, namely the star, crescent and lotus flower patterns. Varieties of interior mandalas are successfully generated using these proposed patterns based on the hierarchical structures observed from hand drawn mandalas. The experimental results show that our approach can efficiently generate beautifully-layered colorful interior mandalas, which significantly reduces the time and efforts in manual production and, more importantly, contributes to the digitization of this great heritage.",

    "abstract": "The visual analysis of eye movement data is a challenging task since the data has an inherent spatio-temporal nature and is typically recorded by measuring the eye movements of various study participants and sometimes, over long time periods. Finding similar strategies among the participants while applying a visual scanning strategy is one of the most important but also most difficult tasks. In this paper we describe the eye movement plots with which we are able to visually encode the eye movement fixation sequences of several study participants as a stacked line-based representation. The two-dimensional fixation points are mapped to a time-dependent sequence of lines while edge splatting is applied to visually augment the otherwise cluttered diagrams. With this visualization concept, time-varying eye movement patterns become visible, comparable, and generate an overview representation for a set of eye movements allowing comparison tasks. We illustrate the usefulness of the technique by means of applying it to formerly recorded eye tracking data by investigating route finding tasks in public transport systems. Moreover, we describe challenges, limitations, and scalability issues of the approach.",

Those multivariate data are too complex for laymen like museum visitors to first, get an overview about all paintings and to look for specific categories. Finally, the goal is to guide the visitor to a specific painting that he wishes to have a more closer look on. In this paper we describe an interactive visualization tool that first provides such an overview and lets people experiment with the more than 41,000 paintings collected in the web gallery of art. To generate such an interactive tool, our technique is composed of different steps like data handling, algorithmic transformations, visualizations, interactions, and the human user working with the tool with the goal to detect insights in the provided data. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to such characteristic data and show how one can get from an overview about all paintings to specific paintings.",

    "abstract": "Treemaps have been used in information visualisation for over two decades. They make use of nested filled areas to represent information hierarchies such as file systems, library catalogues, etc. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of visualisations that resemble geographic maps. In this paper we present a study that compares the performance of one such map-like visualisation with the original two forms of the treemap, namely nested and non-nested treemaps. Our study focused on a quantitative evaluation of accuracy and speed. We found that accuracy was highest for the map-like visualisations, followed by nested treemaps and lastly non-nested treemaps. Task performance was fastest for nested treemaps, followed by non-nested treemaps, and then map-like visualisations. We conclude that the results regarding accuracy are promising for the use of map-like visualisations in tasks involving the visualisation of hierarchical information, even at the expense of somewhat longer performance times.",

This paper addresses the following question: does manipulating the size of visual elements affect the comprehension of LineSets? We empirically evaluated two types of size treatments applied to LineSets drawn on networks: varying set-line thickness, to reflect relative set cardinality, and varying node diameter, to reflect data items' relative degree of connectivity. The evaluation required participants to perform tasks that were thought to be aided by the size variations alongside tasks where no benefit was anticipated. Viewing comprehension through accuracy and time performance, we found that varying set-line thickness and node diameter significantly improves the effectiveness of LineSets. As a consequence, this research leads to the recommendation that LineSets vary sizes of lines and nodes.",

    "abstract": "Data Analysts have to deal with an ever-growing amount of data resources. One way to make sense of this data is to extract features and use clustering algorithms to group items according to a similarity measure. Algorithm developers are challenged when evaluating the performance of the algorithm since it is hard to identify features that influence the clustering. Moreover, many algorithms can be trained using a semi-supervised approach, where human users provide ground truth samples by manually grouping single items. Hence, visualization techniques are needed that help data analysts achieve their goal in evaluating Big data clustering algorithms. In this context, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) has become a prominent visualization tool. In this paper, we propose a combination with glyphs that can provide a detailed view of specific features involved in MDS. In consequence, human users can understand, adjust, and ultimately improve clustering algorithms. We present a thorough glyph design, which is founded in a comprehensive survey of related work and report the results of a controlled experiments, where participants solved data analysis tasks with both glyphs and a traditional textual display of data values.",

    "abstract": "Ontologies describe complex world knowledge in that they consist of hierarchical relations, such as is-a, which can be expressed by quantifiers or sets, and various binary relations, which can be expressed by links or networks. Should hierarchical relations be distinguished from other binary relations as essentially different ones in building cognitively accessible systems of ontologies? In this study, two kinds of ontology visualizations, a network-based visualization (SOVA) and a set-based visualization (concept diagrams), are empirically compared in the case of consistency checking. Participants were presented with one diagram and then asked to answer the question of whether the meaning of the diagram was contradictory. Our results showed that SOVA is more effective than concept diagrams, suggesting that to represent hierarchical and binary relations of ontologies in a way based on networks suits human cognition when checking ontologies' consistencies.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing dynamic call graphs is typically done by providing a visual representation that shows the sequence of static graphs placed next to each other. Such a time-to-space mapping is useful to visually compare the graphs and to see the changing graph structure, but, negatively, a view on changes between all pairs of graphs in the sequence is not provided and detecting similarities of longer call graph subsequences is not well supported. In this paper we describe the dynamic call graph matrix that shows similarities and differences between graph pairs in a graph sequence by applying certain well-known set operations as well as fine-grained and coarse-grained graph views supporting visual scalability. We illustrate the usefulness of our technique by applying it to dynamic call graph data from the open source software project JUnit that contains several inherent dynamic call graph features worth investigating and hard to find by a side-by-side dynamic graph visualization alone.",

However, in many situations it is useful to provide set membership information for elements in networks. We present BranchingSets, an interactive visualization technique that uses visual encodings similar to Kelp Diagrams in order to augment traditional node-link diagrams with information about the categories that both nodes and links belong to. BranchingSets introduces novel user-driven methods to procedurally navigate the graph topology and to interactively inspect complex, hierarchical data associated with individual nodes. Results indicate that users find the technique engaging and easy to use. This is further confirmed by a quantitative study that compares the effectiveness of the visual encodings used in BranchingSets to other techniques for displaying set membership within node-link diagrams, finding our technique more accurate and more efficient for facilitating interactive queries on networks containing nodes that belong to multiple sets.",

    "abstract": "Reading academic paper is a daily task for researchers and graduate students. However, reading effectively can be challenging, particularly for novices in scientific research. For example, when readers are reading the related work section that cites a fair number of references in limited page space, they often need to flip back and forth between the text and the references and may also frequently search elsewhere for more information about the references. This increases the difficulty of understanding a paper. In this paper, we propose a narrative visualization system that helps the reading of academic papers. As a first step, we adopt narrative visualization to present literature review as interactive slides. Specifically, we propose a narrative structure with three levels of granularities that the reader can drill down or roll up freely. The logic flow of a slideshow can be organized based on the paper's presentation or citations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through several case studies and user studies. The results show that the system allows users to quickly track and glance related work, making paper reading more effective and enjoyable.",

However, huge amounts of raw data, coupled with incomplete or inconsistent records, may turn into an obstacle for the effective use of the available information. The need for effective movement data analysis has resulted in a large number of visual analytics tools and specialized views. There are still many challenges in public transportation and other kinds of cyclic movement data analysis. In this paper we address some of those challenges by presenting an improvement of the standard map view. This improved view is specifically designed to simplify and make the visual analysis of complex movement data easier to perform, especially when integrated in a coordinated multiple views tool and articulated together with other techniques. We illustrate the effectiveness of the view on public transportation data from Bahía Blanca, Argentina.",

    "abstract": "Image saliency is a biologically inspired concept for characterizing visual conspicuity of individual features in natural images, and provides us with a useful insight into the mechanism for directing instant visual attention from viewers. Nevertheless, this perceptual quality often remains to be further sophisticated especially for enhancing saliency in infographic images since they usually consist of relatively simple visual pattens that result in sharp image edges rather than smooth gradations in natural images. This paper presents a new approach to intentionally drawing visual attention for infographic images, in such a way that the corresponding important features naturally pop up in the image. The idea behind our approach is to introduce the concept of symmetry saliency for enhancing local symmetry inherent in such infographic images. This is accomplished by evaluating how much each image edge contributes to the symmetry saliency, and augmenting the corresponding image gradient in proportion to the amount of its contribution. The intensity field of the given image is then modulated with such enhanced image edges by solving the Poisson equation. Several examples together with statistics obtained through a user study demonstrate that our proposed approach successfully improves the readability of infographic images and effectively attracts visual attention to intended regions of interest.",

    "abstract": "Clarity, simplicity and visual adjustability to the preference of the analyst are key aspects of the visualization techniques required by visual analytics in broad sense. Scatterplots and scatterplot matrices are commonly used for visually analyzing multidimensional multivariate data. This paper presents a new approach for deep visual exploration of large multi-attribute data using linkable scatterplots. Proposed method overcomes the limitations of the single scatterplot by providing more plot panels for better comparison while it reduces the unnecessary number of panels of the scatterplot matrix method. The panels are fully interactive and linking together where variables can be mapped on axes independently or on common visual attributes such as color, size and shape. We illustrate the effectiveness of proposed linkable scatterplot method on various data sets.",

To address this issue, we present visibility widgets: compact auxiliary views that visualize occluded data, their locations, and related properties, and thus, support users in revealing hidden information. Our widgets comprise different occlusion management strategies for detecting and analyzing invisible data inside as well as outside of the field of view. In addition, each widget is designed complementary and transient to facilitate interactive exploration and navigation while not monopolizing the user's attention. We demonstrate the application of our visibility widgets in a flexible visualization tool, focusing on visual exploration of hazardous weather phenomena in 3D terrain.",

    "abstract": "The output of 3D volume segmentation is crucial to a wide range of endeavors. Producing accurate segmentations often proves to be both inefficient and challenging, in part due to lack of imaging data quality (contrast and resolution), and because of ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of the structure and the context wherein it resides. Automatic and semi-automatic approaches are improving, but in many cases still fail or require substantial manual clean-up or intervention. Expert manual segmentation and review is therefore still the gold standard for many applications. Unfortunately, existing tools (both custom-made and commercial) are often designed based on the underlying algorithm, not the best method for expressing higher-level intention. Our goal is to analyze manual (or semi-automatic) segmentation to gain a better understanding of both low-level (perceptual tasks and actions) and high-level decision making. This can be used to produce segmentation tools that are more accurate, efficient, and easier to use. Questioning or observation alone is insufficient to capture this information, so we utilize a hybrid capture protocol that blends observation, surveys, and eye tracking. We then developed, and validated, data coding schemes capable of discerning low-level actions and overall task structures.",

    "abstract": "Using mobile devices to collaborate with other users on a large shared screen supports collaborative tasks and prevents interference among users. Various intuitive gestures have been proposed to support interaction across a tabletop and a mobile device. Different from previous studies that focused on designing gestures, this paper investigates the fundamental difference between one-handed and two-handed interaction styles that involve a tabletop and a mobile device. In the study, we consider two factors, i.e., the selection order (sequential or random order) and the density level (sparse or dense layout), which form four tasks. The study was conducted as a pretest-posttest, repeated-measures experiment. All the participants go through all the tasks using both interaction styles. During the experiment, both the completion time and the error rate in each task with each interaction style are recorded. In addition, the IBM Post-Study Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) is used to evaluate the subjective satisfaction on each interaction style. The overall PSSUQ score indicates that both interaction styles receive positive feedback with high user satisfaction. The one-handed interaction is significantly more efficient than the two-handed interaction in all four tasks. On the other hand, the two-handed interaction has a lower error rate than the one-handed interaction, especially significantly lower in a dense layout.",

Apart from this obvious purpose, the metaphor of maps has been applied to other uses as well, such as information visualisation and novel user interfaces. Various methods exist for creating geographic map-like visualisations. Yet there is little understanding on how people perceive these graphical presentations as geographic maps, and how to make these information visualisations look like geographic maps. We attempt to find preliminary answers on these issues by conducting a user study with a series of map-like visualisations. In this paper, we report on the results of this study and reveal the factors that have an impact on the human perception of visualisations that are designed to resemble geographic maps. Based on this, we propose design suggestions for the future development of map-like visualisations.",

When one estimates relative values relying on visual stimuli, perceptual bias may weaken the accuracy and bring about risks. This research explores how people estimate relative values heuristically using visual cues with different dimensional information, i.e., linear, areal and volumetric information. We conduct experiments to empirically testify the influences of dimensional information on perceptual biases. First, we confirm the conspicuity of areal information. When instructed to estimate rates exclusively relying on either linear or volumetric information, people would inevitably be influenced by the corresponding rates determined by areal information. Second, we provide evidences that visual cues implying depth would lead to overestimates. This research provides implications for designers to enhance the power of visual persuasions, and for users to improve their decision making quality.",

Existing solutions of mining interesting association rules are based on the support-confidence theory. However, it is non-trivial for the user to understand and modify the rules or the results of intermediate steps in the mining process, because the interestingness of rules might differ largely for various tasks and users. In this paper we propose to reinforce conventional association rule mining process by mapping the entire process into a visualization assisted loop, with which the user workload for modulating parameters and mining rules is reduced, and the mining efficiency is greatly improved. A matrix-based visualization technique is employed to encode the measure computation value, the data distribution and the intermediate results. We also design a set of visual exploration tools to support interactively inspection and manipulation of association measures, constraints of different types, and the results of intermediate steps. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The process of political decision making is often complex and tedious. The policy process consists of multiple steps, most of them are highly iterative. In addition, different stakeholder groups are involved in political decision making and contribute to the process. A series of textual documents accompanies the process. Examples are official documents, discussions, scientific reports, external reviews, newspaper articles, or economic white papers. Experts from the political domain report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability to keep track of the entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks for large sets of textual documents in the political decision making process. In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in political decision making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts. Finally, we present the results of three evaluation rounds, and reflect on our collaborative visualization system.",

However, exploring the spatiotemporal text data and characterizing the evolution of topics over time and space are challenging due to the complexity of such data and associated activities. This paper proposes a new approach to exploring the spatiotemporal text data with visual filters. We introduce a notion of topic trajectory to depict the spatiotemporal evolution of topics. Multiple coordinated visualizations provided in our visualization system enable users to explore topic trajectories and develop their contextual awareness in terms of how information flows across different regions. We demonstrate the use of our system with an analysis of a dataset contributed by users of widely used science mapping software CiteSpace.",

Numerous studies focus on the user's influence in different types of social network and visualize user and event propagation process. However, little works is done to visualize and analyze the social influence of breaking events. To fill this gap, we propose VIBES, a hybrid model that combines both event popularity and event public attention to quantitatively measure and visualize event social influence through time at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Experimental results based on two real-world event datasets from Weibo validate the effectiveness of VIBES for accurately capturing breaking sub-events as well as visualizing event social influence from different temporal granularity. The visualization results produced by VIBES are not only useful for public users to have a better understanding of breaking events, but also helpful for mass media and and government agencies to mediate and stabilize the outbreak of event.",

    "abstract": "Image mosaicing involves splitting an input image into a set of tiles, then replacing each tile with another image from a large dataset so that, when viewed from a distance, the resulting image resembles the original. We present a new approach for generating image mosaics using variable sized tiles made up from patches taken from photographs, paintings and texture images. This is different from previous work, where either simple regular tiling or adaptive tiling based on variations of RGB color was used. We propose an adaptive tiling theme by means of region entropy. In order to avoid the mismatch in roughness between the sub-image in the tile region of the input image and tile images in the dataset that may arise in the previous RGB color based image descriptors, we introduce the region entropy into the image descriptor to achieve better matching in both color and roughness. We also propose a new metric to measure the quality of the image mosaic which takes both the similarity and the mutual information between the generated mosaics and input images into account. The final mosaic images in this work are obtained by optimizing an objective function based on this metric.",

Combining the artist's aesthetic theory with the authors' own understanding, the paper analyzes the characteristics of Miro's work and proposes a process modeling approach that consists of four steps: structured drawing, adaptive coloring, space filling and noise injection. The generation process is described in details and sample generated images styled on Miro's paintings are also demonstrated and discussed. By extracting and coding pictorial elements in paintings of Miro, different styled images could be generated under different sets of parameters.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of economy in China, environmental problems are increasingly affecting people's daily life and work. Xuecheng area of Shandong Zao Zhuang is one of the oldest coal towns in China. Coal income is one of the main sources of local economy. Heavy dusts, produced by the coal mines and large cement plants, are seriously affecting the air quality index (AQI) and impairing local residents' health. Consequently, people in this area have to reduce their outdoor activities, which has led to loss of the town's vitality. In this paper, based on design strategy, the source of inspiration and medium and from the overall perspective, we design an innovative ecological Street Community Park, applying the concept of \"Cradle to Cradle\".",

Direct interaction techniques enable scientists to leverage their visual-cognitive skills for identifying and selecting visually rendered data. However, fatigue, data density, rendering, and visual encoding issues may result in reduced usage of immersive scientific visualizations. In this paper, we present algorithmic details of a novel volume selection interaction, implementation details, and discuss use case scenario. Our technique seeks to improve usage of immersive visualizations for scientific discovery and insight.",

It analyzed the dilemma of tobacco control, made interpretation of images in the public service ads from three perspectives, namely, reproduction sense, interactive sense and composition sense. With the case study of the tobacco control advertising of DNF, this paper made voice analysis as well as the analysis of advertising visual communication power construction from three different perspectives. The rational use of visual grammar can enhance the communication power of tobacco advertising, thus psychologically affecting the audiences' attitude towards tobacco.",
