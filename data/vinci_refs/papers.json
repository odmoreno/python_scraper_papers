    "abstract": "A common enhancement of scatterplots represents points as small multiples, glyphs, or thumbnail images. As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.",

    "abstract": "Scatterplot selection is an effective approach to represent essential portions of multidimensional data in a limited display space. Various metrics for evaluating scatterplots, such as scagnostics, have been devised and applied to scatterplot selection. This paper presents a new scatterplot selection technique that applies multiple metrics. First, the technique calculates the scores of scatterplots with multiple metrics and then constructs a graph by connecting similar scatterplots. Next, it uses a graph coloring algorithm to assign different colors to similar scatterplots. We can extract a set of various scatterplots by selecting them that the specific same color is assigned. This paper introduces a visualization example with a retail dataset containing multidimensional climate and sales values.",

Small-sized factories intend to take full advantage of the data collected by sensors used in their machinery. The ultimate goal is to minimize cost and maximize quality, resulting in an increase in profit. In collaboration with domain experts, we implemented a data visualization tool to enable decision-makers in a plastic factory to improve their production process. We investigate three different aspects: methods for preprocessing multivariate time series data, clustering approaches for the already refined data, and visualization techniques that aid domain experts in gaining insights into the different stages of the production process. Here we present our ongoing results grounded in a human-centered development process. We adopt a formative evaluation approach to continuously upgrade our dashboard design that eventually meets partners’ requirements and follows the best practices within the field.",

    "abstract": "Immersive analytics is a fast growing field that is often applied in virtual reality (VR). VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the extent to which animated procedural texture patterns can be used to support the representation of changes in 2.5D treemaps. Changes in height, color, and area of individual nodes can easily be visualized using animated transitions. Especially for changes in the color attribute, plain animated transitions are not able to directly communicate the direction of change itself. We show how procedural texture patterns can be superimposed to the color mapping and support transitions. To this end, we discuss qualitative properties of each pattern, demonstrate their ability to communicate change direction both with and without animation, and conclude which of the patterns are more likely to increase effectiveness and correctness of the change mapping in 2.5D treemaps.",

    "abstract": "Eye movements are closely related to the cognitive processes and often act as a window to the brain and mind. To facilitate a window to the brain using eye movements, we propose EyeFIX, an interactive visual analytics interface. Our interface currently focuses on processing gaze movements to generate the two most prominent events, fixations, and saccades which are used in a large part of the eye movement literature. Our interface has multiple interactive widgets that allow the users to choose the algorithm and tune its hyper parameters that control how fixations and saccades are generated. It has four major visualizations: (1) A Gaze Plot to showcase the gaze movement of each participant, (2) a Fixation Plot that helps to identify regions of the stimulus which are of interest to a particular participant, (3) a Heat Map to study the denser regions of fixation and regions which the participant frequently visited, and (4) a Timeline Visualization to assist in having a closer look at temporal regions of interest. We design a set of brushing and linking operators that allow users to interactively control all the visualizations to dig deeper in both, the spatial and temporal domains. We demonstrate the applicability of our interface with datasets obtained by human subjects viewing naturalistic stimuli while performing various viewing tasks, including visual exploration, visual search, and prolonged visual fixation.",

We address this gap by assessing inter-annotator agreement on a preliminary annotation scheme for segmenting areas of comic pages, and assigning referents or classifications to these segmentations. A browser-based annotation tool and inter-annotator agreement measures are introduced. We find high agreement for segmentation tasks, while reference tasks show adequate agreement as well as instructive disagreements showing constraints on reader interpretation.",

We present SPLORT, as a user-centered web-based solution for segmented Visual Analytics. The tool involves a “What-Where-When” pyramidal paradigm to drive Spatio-temporal analysis towards the findings of new insights. It features multi-layered coordinated views to help the analyst navigate and explore multivariate data simultaneously. We evaluated this web-based tool, and reported the findings and results, considering users’ performance and perceptions, basing our analysis on their Likert scale (0-5) responses, regarding their experience and the tool's usability, and the sentiment of their feedback, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our findings from the pilot study held, suggest that SPLORT successfully allows the users to visually query, explore and analyze contextless multi-scale attributes within space and time, which quickly drives them to new insights and to support easier decision-making processes. Moreover, the tool's flexibility, due to its multi-layered GUI, supports better and more friendly visual analytics.",

    "abstract": "Comprehending and exploring large and complex data is becoming increasingly important for a diverse population of users in a wide range of application domains. Visualization has proven to be well-suited in supporting this endeavor by tapping into the power of human visual perception. However, non-experts in the field of visual analysis often have difficulties in correctly reading and interpreting information from novel visualization idioms. Visualization onboarding can support novices in learning how to use new digital technologies. Therefore, we developed an interactive step-by-step guide and applied the method to four visualization techniques—a bar chart, a horizon graph, a change matrix, and a parallel coordinates plot. Results using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers show that there is a need for onboarding, especially for more complex visualization techniques. We further investigated the perception and rating of a scrollytelling and a video tutorial for the most unfamiliar visualization—the parallel coordinates plot. A comparison between the three onboarding methods indicates that participants appreciated the easy-to-understand examples, the precise wording of the onboarding messages in a step-by-step manner, and the introduction of interaction concepts by highlighting the most relevant information over all onboarding methods. The video tutorial supported the introduction of unknown interaction techniques best.",

    "abstract": "Navigation and situation awareness are amongst the most important aspects of collaborative analysis in 3D environments. This paper investigates the latest technology of mixed reality to improve the team navigation through effective real-time communication. We develop a cross-platform collaboration system, supporting different types of devices and operating systems, including Microsoft HoloLens and iOS devices. Our system provides essential coordination and information sharing functions by leveraging on device sensors and Vuforia API of image marker to localize users inside a building. We provide a set of essential building navigation, visualization, and interaction methods to support joint tasks in the physical building environments among participants with mobile devices in real-time. We have performed a user study to evaluate different devices used in coordination tasks. Our results demonstrate the effects of immersive visualization for improving 3D navigation and coordination.",

    "abstract": "There are a variety of graphs where multidimensional feature values are assigned to the nodes. Visualization of such datasets is not an easy task since they are complex and often huge. Immersive Analytics is a powerful approach to support the interactive exploration of such large and complex data. Many recent studies on graph visualization have applied immersive analytics frameworks; however, there have been few studies on immersive analytics for visualization of multidimensional attributes associated with the input graphs. This paper presents a new immersive analytics system that supports the interactive exploration of multidimensional feature values assigned to the nodes of input graphs. The presented system displays ”label-axes” corresponding to the dimensions of feature values, and ”label-edges” that connect label-axes and corresponding to the nodes. The system supports visual linking operations which controls the display of edges that connect a label-axis and nodes of the graph. This paper introduces visualization examples with a graph dataset of Twitter users and reviews by experts on graph data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Due to non-deterministic behavior and thread interleaving of concurrent programs, the debugging of concurrency and performance issues is a rather difficult and often tedious task. In this paper, we present an approach that combines statistical profiling, clustering and visualization to facilitate this task. We implemented our approach in a tool which is integrated as a plugin into a widely used IDE. First, we introduce our approach with details on the profiling and clustering strategy that produce runtime metrics and clusters of threads for source-code artifacts at different levels of abstraction (class and method) and the entire program. Next, we explain the design of our sparkline visualization which represents the clusters in situ, i.e. embedded in the program text next to the related source-code artifact in the source-code editor. More detailed information is available in separate views that also allow the user to interactively configure thread filters. In a demonstration study we illustrate the usefulness of the tool for understanding and fixing performance and concurrency issues. Finally, we report on first formative results from a small-scale user study.",

    "abstract": "Exploratory search starts with ill-defined goals and involves browsing, learning, and formulating new targets for search. To fluidly support such dynamic search behaviours, we focus on devising interactive visual facets (IVF), visualising information facets to support user comprehension and control of the information space. To do this, we reviewed existing faceted search interfaces and derived two design requirements (DR) that have not been fully addressed to support fluid interactions in exploratory search. We then exemplified the requirements through devising an IVF tool, which coordinates a linear and a categorical facet representing the distribution and summarisation of items, respectively, and providing context for faceted exploration (DR1). To support rapid transitions between search criteria (DR2), the tool introduces a novel design concept of using facets to select items without filtering the item space. Particularly, we propose a filter-swipe technique that enables users to drag a categorical facet value sequentially over linear facet bars to view the items in the intersection of the two facets along with the categorical facet dynamically summarizing the items in the interaction. A user study of 11 participants with realistic email search tasks shows that dynamic suggestions through the timeline navigation can help discover useful suggestions for search; the novel design concept was favoured over using facet values as filters. Based on these practices, we derive IVF design implications for fluid, exploratory searches.",

Toward this end, we designed a web-based framework which illustrates the dynamics as time-to-space mappings of dynamic graphs. Such static diagrams of dynamic data have the benefit of being able to display longer time spans in one view, hence supporting the observer with comparison tasks. The tool can show details about how an algorithm traverses a graph step-by-step in a static and animated fashion, for graph algorithm exploration as well as educational purposes. The animation together with the time-to-space mapping forms an overview-and-detail approach. By using flight carrier data from the U.S. Department of Transportation we show the usefulness of our interactive visualization for conveying graph algorithm dynamics.",

We explain this in the context of Ecuador, a country with electoral districts of varied sizes and populations (and, thus, varied voting power). Our visualization is designed to explain that a bigger territory does not necessarily imply more votes. Understanding this concept is particularly important in Ecuador, a country that officially depicts elections results through maps that use color hue to indicate the winning candidate of a given geographical area.",

    "abstract": "Email has lost much of its original function: connecting people. Today, people use it as a task list, a database, and even legal documentation. For these and other reasons, email has become a source of stress; pushing us apart rather than bringing us together. In this paper, we describe POEM (People-Oriented EMail), a prototype email client designed to restore and strengthen email’s socially connective role. Because much of human communication is non-verbal, POEM features a visualization that summarizes user’s inbox by correspondent, using their profile pictures. To highlight human relationships, POEM offers access to detailed correspondent messages only by clicking on their pictures. Encouraging deeper relationships, POEM organizes correspondents by social importance measures including communication effort, balance, and delay before response. We conclude by sketching our plans to evaluate POEM.",

They contain a wealth of information about the opinions and experiences of users, which help better understand consumer decisions and improve products and services. However, the huge volume of reviews makes it difficult for potential customers to gain useful insights and for managers to track customer opinions. To address these problems, we first use topic modeling techniques for customer opinion mining. Then, we build a deep learning network for sentiment analysis. Finally, we perform sentiment analysis of the reviews at the aspect level to obtain the sentiment vector representation of the accommodation. Moreover, we design a visual analytic system with a user-friendly interface to facilitate interactive analysis. Evaluation including user and case studies demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of this system.",

In order for the fluid solution to be stable, we take a more reliable surface particles detection method in the solver. On this basis, instead of computing implicit function from all fluid particles, we only use surface particles by means of SPR. In order to build a smoother, feature-preserved surface, we adapt a fluid particles pre-processing pipeline to compensate for the defects of fluid particles applied to SPR. In experiment, we demonstrate how the SPR can benefit from our pre-processing pipeline and a significant improvement in quality of reconstructed surfaces as compared to existing methods.",

In this paper we describe a visual analysis tool that takes into account a multitude of educational data sources, filters those into the most relevant ones, and derives attributes-of-interest which form a high-dimensional dataset. For this data we apply t-SNE as one possible projection method to visualize and uncover similarities and dissimilarities among the high-dimensional attributes in a lower-dimensional space like in a scatter plot. We also support interaction techniques and further visual variables to encode additional data attributes in the form of color codings, sizes, and shapes. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to educational data sources focusing on pupils and students in Switzerland while also visually communicating the found insights with educational science experts. Finally, we discuss limitations and scalability issues.",

    "abstract": "Treemaps are a commonly used tool for the visual display and communication of tree-structured, multi-variate data. In order to confidently know when and how treemaps can best be applied, the research community uses usability studies and controlled experiments to \"understand the potential and limitations of our tools\" (Plaisant, 2004). To support the communities' understanding and usage of treemaps, this survey provides a comprehensive review and detailed overview of 69 user studies related to treemaps. However, due to pitfalls and shortcomings in design, conduct, and reporting of the user studies, there is little that can be reliably derived or accepted as a generalized statement. Fundamental open questions include configuration, compatible tasks, use cases, and perceptional characteristics of treemaps. The reliability of findings and statements is discussed and common pitfalls of treemap user studies are identified.",

The tool provides ways to upload, share, explore, and compare hierarchical data using a multitude of different linked hierarchy visualizations. The current version supports up to 8 hierarchy visualizations, with the space-reclaiming icicle plots among them. Several of the visualizations can be shown in linked views while typical hierarchy parameters and visual variables can be changed on user demand. The interactive tool makes use of OpenGL and Angular, an industry standard JavaScript platform, and runs in a web browser. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to the NCBI taxonomy that consists of more than 300,000 hierarchically organized species while filtering for the tetrapoda subhierarchy. Finally, we explain implementation details and discuss limitations and scalability issues of the linked visualization techniques.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the bike-sharing system and traditional taxi system as well as their similarities and differences are essential for bike-sharing rebalancing, taxi dispatching, and urban planning. However, due to the sparseness of record data and the difference in service regions, the relationship between them is indeed obscure, and previous solutions mostly focus only on a single system. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics system to investigate the similarities and differences between bike-sharing and taxi systems. The service region for each bike station is created to fuse bike-sharing data and taxi data. We harness two 3-order tensors to represent them in a unified framework to generate potential patterns by tensor decomposition. The visual analytics system integrates two spatiotemporal data sources by analyzing the patterns that are typical of each data source and the patterns that are common to both data sources to assist users in better discovering the relationships between the taxi system and the bike-sharing system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through real-world case studies.",

Understanding the users' travel behavior is invaluable for policy makers and related companies. However, it is difficult to capture the spatio-temporal cycling patterns based on sparse bike-sharing data. In this paper, we analyze the dockless bike-sharing data using tensor decomposition method. A three-dimensional tensor is constructed first, and a tensor decomposition method is employed to detect the underlying travel patterns. Several visual components are designed to show the extracted patterns. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "It is not easy to predict incomplete panel data whose overall trend is not complete. For example, physical growth data for age 7-18 has been collected every a few months for up to seven years; therefore, only short growth pattern pieces exist in the data. When using previous prediction techniques, it is challenging to create a growth prediction model that reflects individual growth patterns. Also, uncertainties in predicted results emerge since the overall trend of the data is unknown. In this work, we present a predictive analysis and modeling to forecast incomplete data over time. We extend the Bayesian network model, which is relative data-driven approaches that explore similar data and weave them to create approximate inference margins. Besides, we propose a visual analytics system that enables us to design various predictive models that reflect individual growth pattern. Our visual analytics system assists us to discover new growth patterns in the process of analyzing the accuracy of previously designed predictive models. Moreover, the system allows us to optimize predictive models to fit unusual growth patterns.",

Epidemiologists have to analyze this epidemiological data on a regular basis.

Unfortunately, manually retrieving the data from a website like Google News and then deriving sensible insights from the huge dataset consumes a lot of time and effort. We present EpidNews, a new visual analytics tool that helps to visualize and explore epidemiological news data for animals. The tool uses several views depicting various levels of abstraction, which helps fulfill almost all the data analysis requirements of epidemiologists. We also present the case study of an epidemiology expert, wherein she assesses the usability and productivity of EpidNews by using the tool in her daily work.",

    "abstract": "Effective visualisation plays a vital role in generating insights from data. The selection of graph types however, is highly dependent on the analysis tasks and data types at hand. For example, spatio-temporal visualisations encode changes in data over time and space. Although they have the potential of revealing overall tendencies and movement patterns, building effective spatio-temporal visualisations is challenging because it requires encoding all three attributes of spatio-temporal data i.e. thematic (values of attributes), temporal and spatial in a single visualisation. In this application design study, we present PedaViz for representing hour-level spatio-temporal attributes within a single visualisation; a 24-hour radial visual metaphor that encodes hour-level temporal and daily temperature attributes while utilising a thematic map display to present spatial attributes. The design was applied on city planning domain using Melbourne's pedestrian count and temperature data. Results of our preliminary user evaluation suggest that our visualisation is easily understandable by users; and supports users in carrying out selected analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "Visualization of customer behavior is urgently needed for an increasing number of customer orders on O2O (online to offline) platform. Although many works have been done on visualizing customer opinion or customer click events of one store, visualizing customer switching behavior among stores is still challenging. The challenge is to show customer order records over time and structure the inter-connection among different stores when customer switching behavior happens. In this work, we focus on Takeout O2O service to present a novel visual analysis system for retailers focusing on customer switching behavior patterns. Firstly we define five customer segments based on switching behavior. Then this system enables temporal-spatial driver exploration for different segments through several interactive views. Moreover, in order to visualize inter-connection sequences, augmented streamgraph with the bundled parallel coordinates is proposed as one alternative technique to visualize temporal event sequences. Case studies through collaboration with domain experts also demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this system in helping customer relationship management.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an image-space contrast enhancement method for color-encoded visualization. The contrast of an image is enhanced through a perceptually-guided approach that interfaces with the user with a single and intuitive parameter of the virtual viewing distance. To this end, we analyze a multiscale contrast model of the input image and test the visibility of bandpass images of all scales at a virtual viewing distance. By adapting weights of bandpass images with a threshold model of spatial vision, this image-based method enhances contrast to compensate for contrast loss caused by viewing the image at a certain distance. Relevant features in the color image can be further emphasized by the user using overcompensation. The method is efficient and can be integrated into any visualization tool as it is a generic image-based post-processing technique. Using highly diverse datasets, we show the usefulness of perception compensation across a wide range of typical visualizations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we take a look into typical interaction scenarios when it comes to visualizing hierarchical data while we particularly focus on one specific candidate that is the visual depiction by generalized Pythagoras trees. Those are visualizations that benefit from their aesthetically appealing appearance since they come close to a visual model of trees growing in nature. Traditionally, those generalized Pythagoras trees are visualized on typical computer screens, clearly indicating the hierarchy, but negatively, the finer substructures are oftentimes not visible anymore due to the display space restriction and the low resolution. Hence, in this paper we describe the generalized Pythagoras trees displayed on largescale high-resolution displays and illustrate the challenges and perspectives when we have to interact with the visual representation by using the technique individually, but also in collaboration. To explore possible interactions we experimented with tablet computers combined with an optical tracking system. We evaluate the effectiveness and aesthetics by means of several modifiable visual parameters and by interacting with the visualization.",

    "abstract": "Shape grammars are powerful in specifying and generating an infinite number of designs by repeatedly applying predefined transformation rules to initial shapes. However, the intractable nature of shape grammars limits its wide use in many applications. Moreover, shape grammars lack a parsing method to automatically validate generated designs. In this paper, we present an approach capable of generating tractable designs and validating generated designs. Our approach transforms polygonal shapes and shape rules in shape grammars to graphs and then uses the spatial graph grammar (SGG) formalism to generate and parse designs. We have evaluated our approach by transforming shapes and shape rules originally specified in a shape grammar for Turkish houses to our graph representation and validating designs with the transformed graph rules on VEGGIE, a graph grammar specification and induction tool. Other shape grammars can be potentially integrated with our approach to extend their capability in generating and validating designs.",

    "abstract": "Moving from the concept of discrete sequences of 2D slides towards smooth 3D multimodal hierarchical presentations promises many improvements in quality and effectiveness of presentations. On the other hand, such a move poses many difficulties, one of which is how to arrange content in a 3D space. This task becomes further complicated when the story-graph of the presentation is evolving and is more complex than a single linear story-path. In this work, we propose a framework for automatically solving the task of 3D content placement, which is based on views --- 3D replacement for slides. We also examplify our proposed approach with two spatial layouts for 3D non-linear presentations: \"nested spheres\" and a 'building', as well as algorithms that automatically create these layouts from an abstract hierarchical story-graph.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells have been in the focus of research for more than a decade, in particular due to its use as alternative source for energy production. However, the molecular processes in these cells are still not completely known, and 3D visualisations may help to understand these complex interactions and processes. In previous work, we presented the stereoscopic 3D (S3D) visualisation of a complete Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cell created with the 3D modelling framework Blender. This animation contained already a scene showing an illustrative membrane model of the thylakoid membrane. During discussion with domain experts, shortcomings of the visualisation for several detailed analysis questions have been identified and it was decided to redefine it.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing and visualizing call relations can provide useful insights into the connectivities and linkings of certain parts of a software system. This can in particular be a good strategy to find software system parts that are interlinked a lot while others typically occur as more or less stand-alone components not called by many others. The challenging problem with call relation data comes from the dynamics of the data, i.e., a call graph can be changing either during the development of a software system or during the execution of the software. The second case mostly leads to long graph sequences changing on a fine-granular temporal scale requiring a suitable overview-based dynamic graph visualization technique. Moreover, identifying certain temporal patterns in the graph evolution can help to detect certain phases of either the evolution of a software system or phases during the execution that can show which components are connected while someone interacts with the runnable software for example. This can particularly be based on graph, layout, or attribute properties, all providing different perspectives on the dynamics of the graph data. We illustrate the usefulness of our visualization technique by applying it to the open source software project JHotDraw. The call graphs are recorded during runtime while typical user interactions are applied.",

    "abstract": "The Internet is constantly evolving and changing over time. Outages, attacks, upgrades, censorships, and policy changes modify the routing very frequently everywhere in the world. To give the possibility to the Internet Service Providers and to the network operators of monitoring such an evolving scenario, many organizations collect the routing changes and give free access to them. We propose, prototype, and evaluate a visual interface, called Upstream Visibility, to display such data. It is based on three views: (1) a global view that, based on stacked area charts, gives the high level trend of the visibility of an IP prefix; (2) a local view allows the user to check the effects over time of the visibility of an IP prefix on specific locations of the network; and (3) a traditional graph animation view. Also, we propose heuristics for producing such type of drawings, evaluating their effectiveness and performance against scenarios describing well-known Internet incidents.",

    "abstract": "Lots of movies are produced every year, too many to watch all of them and in particular, to get an overview about the evolution of typical movie genres and actors playing in them. Moreover, it is a challenging problem to detect correlations among the movies and the actors in those movies, in particular, if we are interested in time-varying data patterns like trends, countertrends, or anomalies and outliers. Those correlations are specifically interesting if they can be inspected on different levels of granularity, e.g., temporal, but also hierarchical in form of country- or continent-based correlations. In this paper we describe the IMDb Explorer, a web-based visualization tool that consists of two major views denoted by the movie cosmos and the career lines. Both views are linked and interactively manipulable while a list of user-defined metrics are explorable. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to the entire movie database provided by IMDb.",

Opinions, stances, arguments, topics, terms, and text documents are usually connected with many-to-many relationships for such tasks. Exploratory visual analysis with interactive tools can help the analysts to get an overview of the topics and opinions, identify particularly interesting documents, and describe main themes of various arguments. In our previous work, we introduced an interactive tool called Topics2Themes that was used for topic and theme analysis of vaccination-related discussion texts with a limited set of stance categories. In this poster paper, we describe an application of Topics2Themes to a different genre of data, namely, political comments from Reddit, and multiple sentiment and stance categories detected with automatic classifiers.",

Thus, it is important to explore how e-health related information is generated and disseminated in these platforms. The aim of our current efforts is to investigate the content and flow of information when people in Sweden use Twitter to talk about diabetes related issues. To achieve our goals, we have used data mining and visualization techniques in order to explore, analyze and cluster Twitter data we have collected during a period of 10 months. Our initial results indicate that patients use Twitter to share diabetes related information and to communicate about their disease as an alternative way that complements the traditional channels used by health care professionals.",

Our timeline visualization of data from one such tool allows us to tell a story about what files were accessed and for how long, in what order files were edited, grown or shrunk, what errors the student ran into, and how those errors were addressed. This can be done without a need to read and replay the entire programming session. In sum, the tool has been used to visualize logs from students that tried to solve programming assignments and we find interesting stories that can help us improve how we address new assignments.",

    "abstract": "Due to the continuous increase in the scale of numerical simulations, research on visualization has shifted to in-situ/in-transit approaches. The interactivity of largescale visualization has also become increasingly important. In order to observe largescale visualization data in detail, high-resolution displays, such as those with 8K or 16K resolutions, give an opportunity to inspire new discovery. With the commoditization of high-resolution displays, tiled display walls (TDWs) have facilitated their use for the collaborative research, where a large screen size is required for sharing the content among multiple sites. In this paper, we propose a remote collaboration method that utilizes a TDW driver (ChOWDER), which enables content sharing among multiple sites even with different display configurations, and a visualization application (HIVE) for dynamic content sharing of interactive visualization results.",

Results show that cloth styles adopted quickly would become unfashionable faster. This may help understanding fashion consumption and thus guide the marketing effort.",

Moreover, it is also possible to link them by certain subject types, author names or groups, or textual content. Such a visualization is in particular useful if there are too many notifications occurring in a short time period to answer and react on immediately, or to keep track of. The interactive visualization is implemented in Java and is easily extendable by additional functionality and interaction techniques. We illustrate theusefulness bytesting itforseveralemailaddresses andmessages from Facebook, Twitter, Ebay, Linkedin, and Researchgate.",

    "abstract": "Using predictive models for data-driven optimization of production lines is a trending topic in manufacturing. A challenge is to support the visualization and management of data and arising uncertainties in various phases. Modern production lines can contain thousands of sensors to collect readings every few milliseconds. When creating predictive models for optimization from this data, its sheer amount not only poses challenges to data storage and management, but also during the different phases of data preparation, modeling, decision making, and executing optimizations. Our research aims at a better support of all these phases with data visualization, with new strategies for the management of uncertainty. Predictive models help operators to identify problems and the degree of wear of tools or parts in production lines. However, data analysts, supervisors, and service technicians must be aware that these models contain uncertainties and the recommendations made by these models should be critically reflected before acceptance. One way to mitigate the negative impact of uncertainties is to use visualization as tool for analyzing the potentials and limits of prediction models. Therefore, we propose a process model for the different activities of optimization in a smart production environment and discuss challenges for the visualization of data and uncertainty in each step.",

In this work we focus on product costing, which deals with the average costs of product components - that vary significantly based on many factors such as inflation, exchange rates, and commodity prices. After experts provide the uncertainty information for single items, decision makers need to quickly understand the cost uncertainties within the hierarchical data structure of the complete product.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy clustering analysis is an effective method to describe the uncertainty relationship between data objects and clusters. However, fuzzy clustering results will become complex and high-dimensional membership degree matrixes when they contain a large number of data points and multiple clusters. In this paper, we propose a Radviz-based interactive visualization to help users understand fuzzy clustering results. Firstly, we utilize the projection mechanism of Radviz to map the membership degree matrixes onto planar and radial pictures, in which data points with low membership uncertainty are located near Radviz circumference, while the others are scattered in the center of Radviz circle. To provide an informative interactive visualization, we then improve traditional Radviz visualization in many aspects, including implementing an optimal and uneven placement of dimension anchors by using the Prim algorithm, designing visual codings of data points and dimension arcs to express statistical information, combining chord diagram to depict the sharing relationship between clusters, and offering a set of interactions to support deeper exploration. Finally, we use a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our visualization.",

Efficient parsing mechanisms are essential to these formalisms. However, the existent parsing algorithms are either inefficient or confined to a minority of graph grammars. This paper introduces the notion of partial precedence, defines the partial precedence graph of a graph grammar and theoretically unveils the existence of a valid parsing path conforming to the topological orderings of the partial precedence graph. Then, it provides algorithms for computing the partial precedence graph and presents an approach to improving general parsing algorithms with the graph based on the drawn conclusion. It is shown that the approach can considerably improve the efficiency of general parsing algorithms.",

But when dealing with large-scale data, there is room for improvement with regard to three issues: insufficient memory space, large time consumption and weak data expression. Therefore, this paper introduces the idea of cluster analysis to the storyline to present the clustering information and reduce the time complexity under the condition where a large number of entities interact in the same period. Meantime a scalable, reusable visualization library of storyline is implemented including some novel interactions.",

Especially, Malware targeted at personal information stored on mobile are hard to detect and risks from usage patterns are even more difficult. Therefore, a means for easy recognition of the problems and the smartphone usage is necessary. In this paper, we present a personal visual analytics (PVA) system for Android security risk lifelog using app permissions to recognize the risk. Our system stores the security-related personal information on the smartphone device and utilizes it to analyze the security risk lifelog. For the risk analysis, we define security risk scores based on the app and permission statistics. Then, several linked visualizations are designed to present the risk lifelog. We have collected the security lifelog data from eight Android smartphone users and analyzed their security matters. Our PVA system enables Android smartphone users to observe, mitigate the security risk, and eventually understand how Android security risk affects their lives. Moreover, we present a user study to evaluate the PVA system with user feedback.",

One example is the visualization of the energy output of power plants. We present a web-based application that aims to provide information about the energy production of a specified region, along with location information about the power plants. The application is intended to be used as a solid data basis for political discussions, nudging, and story telling about the German energy transition to renewables, called \"Energiewende\". It was therefore designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and provide information for a broad spectrum of users that do not need any domain-specific knowledge. Users are able to select different categories of power plants and look up their positions on an overview map. Glyphs indicate their exact positions and a selection mechanism allows users to compare the power output on different time scales using stacked area charts or ThemeRivers. As an evaluation of the application, we have collected web access statistics and conducted an online survey with respect to the intuitiveness, usability, and informativeness.",

    "abstract": "Following recent advances in visual interfaces for search, we investigate how to visualize activity traces to support collaborative information-seeking. We implemented a prototype system that visualizes traces of three types of activities (queries typed, articles bookmarked, and interested keywords) on top of a recent visual search system. The current interface of the system provides an interactive keyword visualization to support exploratory search. We designed two icons to visualize user interactions with the keywords and articles. We also implemented a time line to explicitly display the issued queries and additional details about the interactions. We conducted a longitudinal user study to evaluate the usability of these visualizations. We found that the visualization of traces of issued queries and bookmarked articles help the users to better monitor the progress of the collaborators, increase collaboration, and reassure their findings. Traces of interested keywords support sub-topic identification. Furthermore, activity traces of collaborators help the users to learn about the system features. The findings and the novel collaborative system provide valuable insights and tools into future research on designing interfaces for collaborative information-seeking.",

To exploit machine learning techniques for detecting anomaly status, we should prepare suitable models to express the statuses of moving objects in advance. In this paper, several variations of vector models are introduced. These vector models express the relative trajectories of two moving objects approaching each other. To investigate the features of the vector models, the authors tried to observe them by using panel matrices. By means of visualizations using a panel matrix, we can easily grasp the dependence of vector models to parameters and the similarity among variations of the models.",

The traditional Stock Chart provides limited information to investors as it only displays the price changes of the stock over a period of time. More information could be incorporated in the plot such as the return of a stock, the risk of a stock and the performance of the corporation issuing the stock. Based on the information what an investor concerns most about investment activities, a new style visualization method based on Parallel Coordinates is proposed. This paper will describe this visualization technique in the stock chart context and explain the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model used to construct the Parallel Coordinate.

    "abstract": "Apriori Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a popular data mining technique for deriving association rules from frequent itemsets, and it has a long history. Despite of its popularity, its performance suffers from a bottleneck in scalability. Many attempts were made in the past, including changing the frequent item database structure to sophisticated parallel execution. In this paper an alternative strategy is proposed which centred on segmenting the database in lieu of using the full database. The segmentation is by ensemble method which sifts and selects the most effective clustering algorithm; the resultant segmented data cluster is subsequently used for ARM. Using only a fraction of data transactions which supposedly has a high concentration of expressive data, ARM produces higher quality association rules at shorter time. The proposed ARM model is tested using three cases - bank, homicide and lung cancer. The results confirm the usefulness of this new model - higher quality rules are gained",

As the main view, overview view is used to identify the high-level features of the experiment data, providing the analyst a compact and intuitive view for understanding temporal and multi-dimensional patterns at the same time. Other three visualization techniques, providing complementary views, focusing on temporal features, relationships between different attributes and driving action variations. Several case studies have been conducted using a real-world dataset to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.",

A gene co-expression network is created by computing the correlation between each gene pair in a gene-set. We transform the networks into scale-free networks in order to calculate the dissimilarity weights that are used to create our profiles. Our approach further distinguishes between gene pairs consisting of both, one, or no statistically significant genes. We find that the shapes and density of the profiles provide useful information for identification of disease gene biomarkers. Our results provide a means of visualizing the overall distribution of gene dissimilarity for each gene-set, as well as how gene dissimilarity is linked to the mutual significance of gene pairs within a gene-set.",

    "abstract": "One of the best ways to deal with the problem of knowledge distillation in unstructured text is applying text mining. This machine learning-based approach can provide extracted useful information from large body of texts, in a reasonable time. However, the results are usually in complicated forms, which meant it is a non-trivial task in term of interpretation. In this paper, we present appropriate visualizations and analyses in order to tackle the tangled network representing relationship between entities (i.e. terms extracted from raw text). Conducted on a case study of information extraction in the business management domain, our results reveal the hidden relationships of inter-organizational success factors in a simple structured way. These results can assist companies to understand and generate business strategies, in terms of the collaboration aspect.",

    "abstract": "We present a preliminary design study for utilizing eye tracking to support interacting with a multi-document visualization. Complex information seeking tasks can involve collection and comparison of multiple documents, resulting in long and sustained search sessions. The sustained and evolving nature of the session also provides the search interface the opportunity to gather information on the user state and interaction history, which can be used to adapt the information content and representation. We designed a system to evaluate how eye tracking information can be used for adapting the visual salience of information entities. The interface features documents and related keywords that are arranged in a radial layout configuration called the intent radar. Reading history and visual attention, as registered by eye tracking data, are respectively used to trace read items and for visual cueing. We evaluated the interface with 16 participants to gather subjective feedback about specific components and features of the interface. The overall results show that the interface and gaze-related appearance of keywords was positively received by the users.",

    "abstract": "The mandala thangka, as a religious art in Tibetan Buddhism, is an invaluable cultural and artistic heritage. However, drawing a mandala is both time and effort consuming and requires mastery skills due to its intricate details. Retaining and digitizing this heritage is an unresolved research challenge to date. In this paper, we propose a computer-aided generation approach of mandala thangka patterns to address this issue. Specifically, we construct parameterized models of three stylistic patterns used in the interior mandalas of Nyingma school in Tibetan Buddhism according to their geometric features, namely the star, crescent and lotus flower patterns. Varieties of interior mandalas are successfully generated using these proposed patterns based on the hierarchical structures observed from hand drawn mandalas. The experimental results show that our approach can efficiently generate beautifully-layered colorful interior mandalas, which significantly reduces the time and efforts in manual production and, more importantly, contributes to the digitization of this great heritage.",

    "abstract": "The visual analysis of eye movement data is a challenging task since the data has an inherent spatio-temporal nature and is typically recorded by measuring the eye movements of various study participants and sometimes, over long time periods. Finding similar strategies among the participants while applying a visual scanning strategy is one of the most important but also most difficult tasks. In this paper we describe the eye movement plots with which we are able to visually encode the eye movement fixation sequences of several study participants as a stacked line-based representation. The two-dimensional fixation points are mapped to a time-dependent sequence of lines while edge splatting is applied to visually augment the otherwise cluttered diagrams. With this visualization concept, time-varying eye movement patterns become visible, comparable, and generate an overview representation for a set of eye movements allowing comparison tasks. We illustrate the usefulness of the technique by means of applying it to formerly recorded eye tracking data by investigating route finding tasks in public transport systems. Moreover, we describe challenges, limitations, and scalability issues of the approach.",

Those multivariate data are too complex for laymen like museum visitors to first, get an overview about all paintings and to look for specific categories. Finally, the goal is to guide the visitor to a specific painting that he wishes to have a more closer look on. In this paper we describe an interactive visualization tool that first provides such an overview and lets people experiment with the more than 41,000 paintings collected in the web gallery of art. To generate such an interactive tool, our technique is composed of different steps like data handling, algorithmic transformations, visualizations, interactions, and the human user working with the tool with the goal to detect insights in the provided data. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to such characteristic data and show how one can get from an overview about all paintings to specific paintings.",

    "abstract": "Treemaps have been used in information visualisation for over two decades. They make use of nested filled areas to represent information hierarchies such as file systems, library catalogues, etc. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of visualisations that resemble geographic maps. In this paper we present a study that compares the performance of one such map-like visualisation with the original two forms of the treemap, namely nested and non-nested treemaps. Our study focused on a quantitative evaluation of accuracy and speed. We found that accuracy was highest for the map-like visualisations, followed by nested treemaps and lastly non-nested treemaps. Task performance was fastest for nested treemaps, followed by non-nested treemaps, and then map-like visualisations. We conclude that the results regarding accuracy are promising for the use of map-like visualisations in tasks involving the visualisation of hierarchical information, even at the expense of somewhat longer performance times.",

    "abstract": "LineSets represent information about sets by drawing one line for each set on an existing visualization of data items. This paper addresses the following question: does manipulating the size of visual elements affect the comprehension of LineSets? We empirically evaluated two types of size treatments applied to LineSets drawn on networks: varying set-line thickness, to reflect relative set cardinality, and varying node diameter, to reflect data items' relative degree of connectivity. The evaluation required participants to perform tasks that were thought to be aided by the size variations alongside tasks where no benefit was anticipated. Viewing comprehension through accuracy and time performance, we found that varying set-line thickness and node diameter significantly improves the effectiveness of LineSets. As a consequence, this research leads to the recommendation that LineSets vary sizes of lines and nodes.",

    "abstract": "Data Analysts have to deal with an ever-growing amount of data resources. One way to make sense of this data is to extract features and use clustering algorithms to group items according to a similarity measure. Algorithm developers are challenged when evaluating the performance of the algorithm since it is hard to identify features that influence the clustering. Moreover, many algorithms can be trained using a semi-supervised approach, where human users provide ground truth samples by manually grouping single items. Hence, visualization techniques are needed that help data analysts achieve their goal in evaluating Big data clustering algorithms. In this context, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) has become a prominent visualization tool. In this paper, we propose a combination with glyphs that can provide a detailed view of specific features involved in MDS. In consequence, human users can understand, adjust, and ultimately improve clustering algorithms. We present a thorough glyph design, which is founded in a comprehensive survey of related work and report the results of a controlled experiments, where participants solved data analysis tasks with both glyphs and a traditional textual display of data values.",

    "abstract": "Ontologies describe complex world knowledge in that they consist of hierarchical relations, such as is-a, which can be expressed by quantifiers or sets, and various binary relations, which can be expressed by links or networks. Should hierarchical relations be distinguished from other binary relations as essentially different ones in building cognitively accessible systems of ontologies? In this study, two kinds of ontology visualizations, a network-based visualization (SOVA) and a set-based visualization (concept diagrams), are empirically compared in the case of consistency checking. Participants were presented with one diagram and then asked to answer the question of whether the meaning of the diagram was contradictory. Our results showed that SOVA is more effective than concept diagrams, suggesting that to represent hierarchical and binary relations of ontologies in a way based on networks suits human cognition when checking ontologies' consistencies.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing dynamic call graphs is typically done by providing a visual representation that shows the sequence of static graphs placed next to each other. Such a time-to-space mapping is useful to visually compare the graphs and to see the changing graph structure, but, negatively, a view on changes between all pairs of graphs in the sequence is not provided and detecting similarities of longer call graph subsequences is not well supported. In this paper we describe the dynamic call graph matrix that shows similarities and differences between graph pairs in a graph sequence by applying certain well-known set operations as well as fine-grained and coarse-grained graph views supporting visual scalability. We illustrate the usefulness of our technique by applying it to dynamic call graph data from the open source software project JUnit that contains several inherent dynamic call graph features worth investigating and hard to find by a side-by-side dynamic graph visualization alone.",

However, in many situations it is useful to provide set membership information for elements in networks. We present BranchingSets, an interactive visualization technique that uses visual encodings similar to Kelp Diagrams in order to augment traditional node-link diagrams with information about the categories that both nodes and links belong to. BranchingSets introduces novel user-driven methods to procedurally navigate the graph topology and to interactively inspect complex, hierarchical data associated with individual nodes. Results indicate that users find the technique engaging and easy to use. This is further confirmed by a quantitative study that compares the effectiveness of the visual encodings used in BranchingSets to other techniques for displaying set membership within node-link diagrams, finding our technique more accurate and more efficient for facilitating interactive queries on networks containing nodes that belong to multiple sets.",

    "abstract": "Reading academic paper is a daily task for researchers and graduate students. However, reading effectively can be challenging, particularly for novices in scientific research. For example, when readers are reading the related work section that cites a fair number of references in limited page space, they often need to flip back and forth between the text and the references and may also frequently search elsewhere for more information about the references. This increases the difficulty of understanding a paper. In this paper, we propose a narrative visualization system that helps the reading of academic papers. As a first step, we adopt narrative visualization to present literature review as interactive slides. Specifically, we propose a narrative structure with three levels of granularities that the reader can drill down or roll up freely. The logic flow of a slideshow can be organized based on the paper's presentation or citations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through several case studies and user studies. The results show that the system allows users to quickly track and glance related work, making paper reading more effective and enjoyable.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a novel radial visualization of IDS alerts, named IDSPlanet, which helps administrators identify false positives, analyze attack patterns, and understand evolving network conditions. Inspired by celestial bodies, IDSPlanet is composed of Chrono Rings, Alert Continents, and Interactive Core. These components correspond with temporal features of alert types, patterns of behavior in affected hosts, and correlations amongst alert types, attackers and targets. The visualization provides an informative picture for the status of the network. In addition, IDSPlanet offers different interactions and monitoring modes, which allow users to interact with high-interest individuals in detail as well as to explore overall pattern.",

    "abstract": "Public transportation movement data provide a wealth of information and insights into many aspects of urban life and human behavior. However, huge amounts of raw data, coupled with incomplete or inconsistent records, may turn into an obstacle for the effective use of the available information. The need for effective movement data analysis has resulted in a large number of visual analytics tools and specialized views. There are still many challenges in public transportation and other kinds of cyclic movement data analysis. In this paper we address some of those challenges by presenting an improvement of the standard map view. This improved view is specifically designed to simplify and make the visual analysis of complex movement data easier to perform, especially when integrated in a coordinated multiple views tool and articulated together with other techniques. We illustrate the effectiveness of the view on public transportation data from Bahía Blanca, Argentina.",

    "abstract": "Image saliency is a biologically inspired concept for characterizing visual conspicuity of individual features in natural images, and provides us with a useful insight into the mechanism for directing instant visual attention from viewers. Nevertheless, this perceptual quality often remains to be further sophisticated especially for enhancing saliency in infographic images since they usually consist of relatively simple visual pattens that result in sharp image edges rather than smooth gradations in natural images. This paper presents a new approach to intentionally drawing visual attention for infographic images, in such a way that the corresponding important features naturally pop up in the image. The idea behind our approach is to introduce the concept of symmetry saliency for enhancing local symmetry inherent in such infographic images. This is accomplished by evaluating how much each image edge contributes to the symmetry saliency, and augmenting the corresponding image gradient in proportion to the amount of its contribution. The intensity field of the given image is then modulated with such enhanced image edges by solving the Poisson equation. Several examples together with statistics obtained through a user study demonstrate that our proposed approach successfully improves the readability of infographic images and effectively attracts visual attention to intended regions of interest.",

Scatterplots and scatterplot matrices are commonly used for visually analyzing multidimensional multivariate data. This paper presents a new approach for deep visual exploration of large multi-attribute data using linkable scatterplots. Proposed method overcomes the limitations of the single scatterplot by providing more plot panels for better comparison while it reduces the unnecessary number of panels of the scatterplot matrix method. The panels are fully interactive and linking together where variables can be mapped on axes independently or on common visual attributes such as color, size and shape. We illustrate the effectiveness of proposed linkable scatterplot method on various data sets.",

To address this issue, we present visibility widgets: compact auxiliary views that visualize occluded data, their locations, and related properties, and thus, support users in revealing hidden information. Our widgets comprise different occlusion management strategies for detecting and analyzing invisible data inside as well as outside of the field of view. In addition, each widget is designed complementary and transient to facilitate interactive exploration and navigation while not monopolizing the user's attention.

    "abstract": "The output of 3D volume segmentation is crucial to a wide range of endeavors. Producing accurate segmentations often proves to be both inefficient and challenging, in part due to lack of imaging data quality (contrast and resolution), and because of ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of the structure and the context wherein it resides. Automatic and semi-automatic approaches are improving, but in many cases still fail or require substantial manual clean-up or intervention. Expert manual segmentation and review is therefore still the gold standard for many applications. Unfortunately, existing tools (both custom-made and commercial) are often designed based on the underlying algorithm, not the best method for expressing higher-level intention. Our goal is to analyze manual (or semi-automatic) segmentation to gain a better understanding of both low-level (perceptual tasks and actions) and high-level decision making. This can be used to produce segmentation tools that are more accurate, efficient, and easier to use. Questioning or observation alone is insufficient to capture this information, so we utilize a hybrid capture protocol that blends observation, surveys, and eye tracking. We then developed, and validated, data coding schemes capable of discerning low-level actions and overall task structures.",

    "abstract": "Using mobile devices to collaborate with other users on a large shared screen supports collaborative tasks and prevents interference among users. Various intuitive gestures have been proposed to support interaction across a tabletop and a mobile device. Different from previous studies that focused on designing gestures, this paper investigates the fundamental difference between one-handed and two-handed interaction styles that involve a tabletop and a mobile device. In the study, we consider two factors, i.e., the selection order (sequential or random order) and the density level (sparse or dense layout), which form four tasks. The study was conducted as a pretest-posttest, repeated-measures experiment. All the participants go through all the tasks using both interaction styles. During the experiment, both the completion time and the error rate in each task with each interaction style are recorded. In addition, the IBM Post-Study Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) is used to evaluate the subjective satisfaction on each interaction style. The overall PSSUQ score indicates that both interaction styles receive positive feedback with high user satisfaction. The one-handed interaction is significantly more efficient than the two-handed interaction in all four tasks. On the other hand, the two-handed interaction has a lower error rate than the one-handed interaction, especially significantly lower in a dense layout.",

    "abstract": "Maps have traditionally been used for representing the surface of the earth and for displaying geographical information. Apart from this obvious purpose, the metaphor of maps has been applied to other uses as well, such as information visualisation and novel user interfaces. Various methods exist for creating geographic map-like visualisations. Yet there is little understanding on how people perceive these graphical presentations as geographic maps, and how to make these information visualisations look like geographic maps. We attempt to find preliminary answers on these issues by conducting a user study with a series of map-like visualisations. In this paper, we report on the results of this study and reveal the factors that have an impact on the human perception of visualisations that are designed to resemble geographic maps. Based on this, we propose design suggestions for the future development of map-like visualisations.",

    "abstract": "A high quality decision-making requires accurate estimations of relative values. When one estimates relative values relying on visual stimuli, perceptual bias may weaken the accuracy and bring about risks. This research explores how people estimate relative values heuristically using visual cues with different dimensional information, i.e., linear, areal and volumetric information. We conduct experiments to empirically testify the influences of dimensional information on perceptual biases. First, we confirm the conspicuity of areal information. When instructed to estimate rates exclusively relying on either linear or volumetric information, people would inevitably be influenced by the corresponding rates determined by areal information. Second, we provide evidences that visual cues implying depth would lead to overestimates. This research provides implications for designers to enhance the power of visual persuasions, and for users to improve their decision making quality.",

    "abstract": "Association rules have been widely used for detecting relations between attribute-value pairs of categorical datasets. Existing solutions of mining interesting association rules are based on the support-confidence theory. However, it is non-trivial for the user to understand and modify the rules or the results of intermediate steps in the mining process, because the interestingness of rules might differ largely for various tasks and users. In this paper we propose to reinforce conventional association rule mining process by mapping the entire process into a visualization assisted loop, with which the user workload for modulating parameters and mining rules is reduced, and the mining efficiency is greatly improved. A matrix-based visualization technique is employed to encode the measure computation value, the data distribution and the intermediate results. We also design a set of visual exploration tools to support interactively inspection and manipulation of association measures, constraints of different types, and the results of intermediate steps. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with various scenarios.",

Experts from the political domain report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability to keep track of the entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks for large sets of textual documents in the political decision making process. In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in political decision making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts.

    "abstract": "Spatially and temporally relevant text data generated on the Internet by users worldwide is of great value for investigating and understanding emerging trends of user interests and how they may evolve over time and space. However, exploring the spatiotemporal text data and characterizing the evolution of topics over time and space are challenging due to the complexity of such data and associated activities. This paper proposes a new approach to exploring the spatiotemporal text data with visual filters. We introduce a notion of topic trajectory to depict the spatiotemporal evolution of topics. Multiple coordinated visualizations provided in our visualization system enable users to explore topic trajectories and develop their contextual awareness in terms of how information flows across different regions. We demonstrate the use of our system with an analysis of a dataset contributed by users of widely used science mapping software CiteSpace.",

Numerous studies focus on the user's influence in different types of social network and visualize user and event propagation process. However, little works is done to visualize and analyze the social influence of breaking events. To fill this gap, we propose VIBES, a hybrid model that combines both event popularity and event public attention to quantitatively measure and visualize event social influence through time at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Experimental results based on two real-world event datasets from Weibo validate the effectiveness of VIBES for accurately capturing breaking sub-events as well as visualizing event social influence from different temporal granularity. The visualization results produced by VIBES are not only useful for public users to have a better understanding of breaking events, but also helpful for mass media and and government agencies to mediate and stabilize the outbreak of event.",

    "abstract": "Image mosaicing involves splitting an input image into a set of tiles, then replacing each tile with another image from a large dataset so that, when viewed from a distance, the resulting image resembles the original. We present a new approach for generating image mosaics using variable sized tiles made up from patches taken from photographs, paintings and texture images. This is different from previous work, where either simple regular tiling or adaptive tiling based on variations of RGB color was used. We propose an adaptive tiling theme by means of region entropy. In order to avoid the mismatch in roughness between the sub-image in the tile region of the input image and tile images in the dataset that may arise in the previous RGB color based image descriptors, we introduce the region entropy into the image descriptor to achieve better matching in both color and roughness. We also propose a new metric to measure the quality of the image mosaic which takes both the similarity and the mutual information between the generated mosaics and input images into account. The final mosaic images in this work are obtained by optimizing an objective function based on this metric.",

Combining the artist's aesthetic theory with the authors' own understanding, the paper analyzes the characteristics of Miro's work and proposes a process modeling approach that consists of four steps: structured drawing, adaptive coloring, space filling and noise injection. The generation process is described in details and sample generated images styled on Miro's paintings are also demonstrated and discussed. By extracting and coding pictorial elements in paintings of Miro, different styled images could be generated under different sets of parameters.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of economy in China, environmental problems are increasingly affecting people's daily life and work. Xuecheng area of Shandong Zao Zhuang is one of the oldest coal towns in China. Coal income is one of the main sources of local economy. Heavy dusts, produced by the coal mines and large cement plants, are seriously affecting the air quality index (AQI) and impairing local residents' health. Consequently, people in this area have to reduce their outdoor activities, which has led to loss of the town's vitality. In this paper, based on design strategy, the source of inspiration and medium and from the overall perspective, we design an innovative ecological Street Community Park, applying the concept of \"Cradle to Cradle\".",

Since the volume of the data is enormous, the data analysis requires large amount of time and effort. It is more problematic when predictive analysis is necessary for futuristic decision making. In order for predictive analysis, there have been many studies to forecast future trends spatiotemporally. However, most of studies provide just future tendency per event using graphs or maps without contextual compositive analysis. In this paper, we present a predictive visual analytics system to provide predictive event patterns. We infer the future event evolution by combining contextually similar cases occurring in the past. We utilize social media data to detect interesting abnormal events and match the detected abnormal events within the past news media data in order to retrieve similar event patterns. Then, we extract future event patterns through compositing contextual relationship among topics included in the similar past patterns. In order to evaluate our VA system, we demonstrate two use cases in this paper and validate our system with possible predictive story lines.",

The robot has a pan-tilt head equipped with a parametric speaker and a USB camera. A sighted trainer can observe the situation of a visually impaired trainee, and control the pan-tilt head to communicate with the trainee over the network. The trainer's voice is outputted from the parametric speaker and then reflected on the surface of a target object. The visually impaired trainee can hear the reflected voice as if it is generated from the object, and thus the robot can let the trainee know the object position. This robot system is applied to the ADL training where visually impaired individuals learn to use various objects arranged in their living environments. In this report, the experimental results of user study are shown.",

    "abstract": "The term code ownership is used in software engineering to describe who authored a certain piece of software. Code ownership is commonly determined by investigating the data from version control systems, defining the owner as the person who contributed the most lines to a file, module, etc. Existing visualisation for ownership usually relies on per-line annotations from the version control system, thus only conveying the information who changed a line the last time, potentially adding some visual cue about how old the respective change is. This, however, can be misleading, because any change of even a single character changes ownership. In this paper, we propose a visualisation that accounts for fractional ownership changes over time on a per-character basis. Our technique incorporates visual cues to convey that typical definitions of ownership have an inherent uncertainty and provides details on the cause of this uncertainty on demand. For our definition of code ownership being a low-level one, we propose implementing the visualisation as an in-situ visualisation in the code editor of modern development environments. We will show examples of the efficacy of our approach and discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional line-based ownership.",

    "abstract": "Scientific data is typically analyzed using visualizations. Large high-resolution displays can facilitate the analysis process since they offer more screen real estate than desktop monitors, which allows visualizing more data in greater detail and working collaboratively. On the other hand, mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are getting more and more popular but do not have sufficient graphics capabilities for advanced scientific visualizations. In this paper, we discuss a client application for Android devices that allows to remote control a scientific visualization framework. Combining the power of remote rendering with the availability, flexibility, and mobility of mobile devices results in a ubiquitous computing solution for scientific visualization. The user interaction with a large high-resolution display is only one possible application scenario. Other scenarios include presentation of results and remote visualization. The design of our Android application fulfills the requirement of all these application scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing dynamic graphs is challenging due to the many data dimensions to be displayed such as graph vertices and edges with their attached weights or attributes and the additional time dimension. Moreover, edge directions with multiplicities and the graph topology are also important inherent features. However, in many dynamic graph visualization techniques each graph in a sequence is treated the same way, i.e., it is visually encoded in the same visual metaphor or even in the same layout. This visualization strategy can be problematic if the graphs are changing topologically over time, i.e., if a sparse graph becomes denser and denser over time or a star pattern is changing into a dense cluster of connected vertices. Such a dynamic graph data scenario demands for a visualization approach which is able to adapt the applied visual metaphor to each graph separately. In this paper we show an idea to solve this problem by using multiple visual metaphors for dynamic graphs which are computed automatically by algorithms analyzing each individual graph based on a given repertoire of graph features. The biggest issue in this technique for the graph dynamics, however, is the preservation of the viewer's mental map at metaphor changes, i.e., to guide him through the graph changes with the goal to explore the data for time-varying patterns. To reach this goal we support the analyst by an interactive highlighting feature.",

By mixing water and sand for artwork creation, we can create different styles of pictures. Our system has three major subsystems: water animation system, sand animation system and rendering system. In the simulation part, we compute the motion of sand and water based on the interactions for water-water, sand-water and sand-sand. In the rendering part, we attempt to balance the rendering quality and the computation cost. We render water using a ray tracing method and the sand is rendered with shadow. Thus, the rendered results of water and sand look like 2.5D. We tested our system and the experimental results showed that the users could create a variety of pictures of sand and water.",

This paper places the artist at the heart of educating patients and carers about their disease by developing a technical process of delivering 3D CT patient stroke data on the Virtual Reality (VR) platform Oculus Rift DK2. VR has already been proven as an efficacious rehabilitation tool for this population but its use in education has not yet been established. This work is being piloted in a new collaboration between the Art & Design Faculty at the University of New South Wales, Australia and the Stroke Rehabilitation Service at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. Importantly, this paper places the artist's at the center of the process -- from developing the concept, to prototyping and creating the final visual aesthetic. The different stages of the technical design process are also described in this paper. These provide an early framework for working with VR in a clinical context.",

    "abstract": "Although many progresses have been accomplished in multimodal interaction, most researchers still treat each modality such as vision and speech, separately. They integrate the results at the application stage. This is because the roles of multiple modalities and their interactions continue to be quantified and precisely understood. However, there are many remaining issues in combining each modality individually. This paper will highlight the main vision problems based on our review for multimodal applications. This review paper will give an overview of the Augmented Reality (AR) technologies which are contributing in most of recent multimodal applications. We cluster vision techniques according to the natural human senses such as face, gesture, and speech that are frequently used in multimodal applications. The main contribution of this paper is to consolidate some of the main issues and approaches in vision-based technique, and to study some of the applications in AR that have been developed within the context of multimodal interaction. We conclude this paper with the future directions.",

Among them, an increasing attention has been devoted to the development of monitoring systems that exploit geographical data about the network under control. This papers focuses on situational awareness and describes a Visual Analytics solution for monitoring and put in tight relation data from network level (computers, routers, etc.) with organization's mission. The goal of the proposed solution is to make security officers aware of both the actual network endangerment level and the impact it actually has on the infrastructure mission, making clear the relationships and the responsibilities that exist between the network level and the business level. The solution proposed is then instantiated on ACEA infrastructure, a company that provides power and water purification services to cities in central Italy (millions of end users).",

    "abstract": "Geoscience observation data refers to the datasets consisting of time series of multiple parameters generated from the sensors at fixed locations. Although a few works have attempted to visualize features of these data, none of them views these data as a specific type and attempts to show the overview in all the space, time and attribute aspects. It is important for domain experts to select interested subsets from huge amounts of observation data according to the high level patterns shown in the overview. We present a novel approach to visualizing geoscience observation data in a compact radial view. Our solution consists of three visual elements. A map showing the spatial aspect is in the center of the visualization, while temporal and attribute aspects are seamlessly combined with the spatial information. Our approach is equipped with interactive mechanisms for highlighting the selected features, adjusting the display range, as well as interactively generating a fisheye view. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach with a usability experiment. Eye tracking records and user feedbacks obtained in the experiment prove the effectiveness of our approach.",

This paper presents a system for product retrieval inspired by psychology of women's shopping activity, and an implementation of the system for apparel products. Our study supposes products which pre-defined keywords are assigned, and prepares icons representing the combination of the keywords. The system intuitively displays various icons in a display space to demonstrate the diversity of the products. When a user selects an interested icon, the system switches the display to a set of images corresponding to the selected icon, so that the user can visually compare the similar products. The system also features user interfaces to input the preference of users, and reflects the input to the evolutionary computation which adjusts the selection of icons to their preferences. It acts real shopping behavior because we often firstly look over the shops to understand the diversity of products, and then close up the particular groups of the products. This paper introduces an experiment which demonstrates the preferable assistance of the shopping behavior of women who are interested in various products.",

The emphasis is specifically on showing content evolution and modification with passage of time. The challenge lies in presenting not only the content as a stand-alone but also understand how the present is related to the past. For example analyzing large volumes of emails can show how communication among a set of people have progressed or evolved over time, may be along with the roles of the communicators. It can also show how the content has changed or evolved. In order to depict the changes, the email repositories are first clustered using a novel algorithm. The clusters are further time-stamped and correlated. User-insights are provided through visualization of these clusters. Results of implementation over two different datasets are presented.",

    "abstract": "The booming of mobile devices and networks leads to an explosive growth in video resources. Efficient video research styles are appealing for facilely exploring video content appropriate to user's intention with a low cognitive load. The style of input becomes particularly relevant during the process of finding a target video clip in a large-scale database on tablets or other mobile devices. Some users have strong allegiance to input text, while others only input sketches. In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of these two input styles and analyze the responses and feedbacks of users. An elaborated user study was conducted to test two different styles of inputting the semantics. Some users preferred to text input because it could describe their objective easily in a short time, yet some users also liked sketch because it helped illustrate the action or orientation clearly and immediately. Combining text with sketch (\"sketch-text\") is efficient for searching video of complex queries. The evaluation results show users' enjoying \"sketch-text\" and its higher performance than other input styles.",

Although metaphors are ubiquitous in information visualization designs, different connotations influence users' information processing dissimilarly. However, visual metaphors imply interfering attributes caused by the source concepts, and lead to backfire effects on users' inferences. Understanding the pros and cons of metaphoric transfer effect in information visualization would help optimizing visualization designs, and improve efficiency and accuracy of information processing. This study empirically examines how metaphors influence different activities of information processing, including comprehension, inference and judgment in information visualization. Metaphors illustrating strongly implying semantic meanings in source domain can improve both the user's conceptual fluency in information comprehension, and the rate of correctness in information searching.",

Comparative visualisation of these simulation results can help understanding the influence of different parameters. However, researchers might need to compare large numbers of variants. Single desktop monitors often do not have the resolution and screen size required for showing a whole ensemble at once with sufficient detail. Wall-sized high-resolution displays can be a solution for this problem. Although a number of studies has been conducted on how large high-resolution displays affect the speed and accuracy of certain tasks, only few of them are related to actual scientific visualisation tasks. We built a system for comparative visualisation of simulation results that can be used with conventional desktop monitors and with large high-resolution displays. We conducted a study using biochemical simulation data to evaluate the impact of screen size and 3D stereo display on a comparison task.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical information is ubiquitous, and analysing such information is one of the common tasks performed by its users. Map-like visualisations, which resemble geographic maps, can be a useful tool for perceiving hierarchical information. Maps have the advantage that the majority of ordinary users can easily understand them without prior training. This paper presents a novel method for visualising hierarchical data in a form resembling a geographic map, using hexagon tiling. Our method can be used for visualising general hierarchical data, such as organisational structures, library catalogues, file systems, and many more. Like treemaps, our new method is area-based, thus it not only reveals hierarchy but also other attributes. Unlike treemaps, however, our method produces visualisations that resemble geographic maps in shape and appearance. Several tactics are employed to control the space-division process and aspect ratio. In this paper we present experiments involving our visualisation, evaluations of results, comparisons with other methods, and discuss advantages and potential issues.",

In our experiments, given the adjacency list of a clustered graph and its predefined clustering information, each participant was asked to manually sketch clustered graphs \"nicely\" from scratch on a tablet system using a stylus. The main feature of this work different from the previous work is to investigate if the user's complex task of sketching clustered graphs \"nicely\" can be alleviated by providing the cluster partition information. Results show that most participants can draw graphs with clear presence of bridge edges and clustering cohesiveness.",

Our contribution also includes various gesture recognition algorithms using two and three fingers such as L-gesture, OK-gesture, Rock-gesture and Scissor-gesture, in addition to full hand and one-finger gestures.

It makes it possible to generate interactive visualization of quantitative data in HTML/SVG. Compared to traditional static data visualization systems such as those featured in Excel and R, G2D3 makes it possible to greatly enhance the amount of conveyed information by means of animation and interaction. Compared to other JavaScript plotting libraries such as Raphaël and D3, G2D3 leverages the expressiveness and the flexibility of the grammar of graphics to concisely generate complex visualization with many plotting dimensions, including time. It makes it possible to create a wide range of graphics with a few lines of code. G2D3 is open source and hosted in GitHub: join us!",

A design shape trend is necessary to read and predict the fast-moving global market environment, in order to design a competitive logo. This study thus created `Logo trend visualization', which is a combination of Radviz and Circle parallel coordinate to provide a guideline to design a competitive logo, based on such background. As a consequence, we suggest that design shape elements such as transformation to surface, overlapping, artificiality, concept of color and rhythm should be emphasized, and that logo trend visualization facilitates the understanding of the trend of a logo, based on the addition (or elimination) of various design shape elements which accordingly creates a new trend.",

This system was designed to facilitate intrinsic motivation of CP patients for a rehabilitation exercise by integrating a gamification framework. In a previous study, we identified patient's strategy changes during the rehabilitation task involving catching. The aim of this study is to develop a data-mining framework that utilizes results from the previous study coupled with real-time visualization and data generation to further the understanding of the strategy changes during the catching task. In this paper, we describe a result of a preliminary development of the proposed framework.",

The attack tends to go unnoticed by users, because, upon infection, there is almost no visible change to the screen or the computer. Moreover, infections can occur merely as a result of a user visiting a web page. The conventional approach to DbD attacks is to use anti-virus(AV) software to detect malware. However, this approach is limited, because AV software does not always correctly detect emerging malware. Therefore, we designed a network-communication visualization system to assist in the detection of DbD attacks. We expect that the proposed visualization system will successfully give an awareness to users of suspicious software downloads.",

Since the computer storage cost has reduced significantly, today we can digitally archive a huge amount of TV news programs. On the other hand, as the archive size grows larger, the cost for browsing and utilizing news video archives also increases significantly. To circumvent this problem, we devised a visualization method called \"News Shot Cloud\" in our former work. The news shot cloud displays TV news shots in the similar manner with the tag clouds. In this poster, we present an enhancement method of the news shot cloud by modifying the thumbnail layout from the conventional linear layout to the circular. The design and the advantages of the new layout are shown with experimental implementation. The new layout is more helpful to identify informative news shots rapidly, and at the same time, it also helps users to examine less-weighted news shots to find lower-ranked but unexpectedly informative ones.",

Due to the potential cluttering and occlusion problems, slow speed and poor interactivity as well as the influence of perspective to the effects of display, 3D visualization techniques have been controversial in the field of information visualization. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel 3D trajectory visualization method employing the immersive virtual reality technology. Compared with the traditional 3D trajectory visualization methods, our method breaks the limitations of the traditional 2D display of 3D visualization, and engages users in a virtual world with optional perspective to observe 3D visualization without over-plotting. Through practical experiments, our work can reduce the over-plotting of 3D visualization results, and provide smooth transition between visualization views and interactions.",

    "abstract": "CoVE is a novel, scalable, interactive tool that can be used to visualize and manage large colonies of laboratory animals. Effective management of large colonies of animals with multiple individual attributes and complicated breeding schemes represents a significant data management challenge in the biological sciences. Currently available software either provides databases for record keeping or generates basic pedigrees but not both. Thus, there is a pressing need for an integrated colony management system that provides a repository for the data and addresses the visualization challenge presented by complex genealogical data. We present CoVE, a colony visualization tool that provides an overview of the entire colony, clusters individuals based on Gender, Litter or Genotype, and provides an individual view of any animal for detailed examination. We demonstrate that CoVE provides an efficient way to manage, generate and view complex pedigree of real world genealogical data from animal colonies, annotated with details of individual attributes. It enables interactive tracing of lineages and identification of censored subjects in tumor studies.",

The existing multidimensional visualizations typically create visual clutter and over-plotting that make it difficult for interaction with data items directly. Our new space filling technique uses horizontal lines to represent multidimensional data items. Each line is logically divided into segments based on color mapping in order to denote the data item with its value. The proposed visualization is space efficient and also avoids the visual clutter and over-plotting problems as we have often observed in other visualizations. In addition, we allow user to interact directly with data on the display which is more intuitive and efficient than other means.",

In this paper, we apply the concept of small multiples representations to visually illustrate the dynamics of a graph. Node-link diagrams are used as the basic visual metaphor for displaying individual graphs of the sequence. To improve the readability of the diagram and reduce visual clutter we apply an edge splatting technique. Here, we discuss the benefits of splatted radial graph layouts on a modifiable 2D grid. Moreover, to obtain a more scalable dynamic graph visualization we interactively support a graph analyst by a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) feature to rapidly flip between the sequences of displayed graphs. The usefulness of the technique is illustrated in two case studies investigating a dynamic call graph and an evolving social network that consists of more than 1,000 graphs.",

    "abstract": "The bag-of-features models is one of the most popular and promising approaches for extracting the underlying semantics from image databases. However, the associated image categorization based on machine learning techniques may not convince us of its validity since we cannot visually verify how the images have been classified in the high-dimensional image feature space. This paper aims at visually rearrange the images in the projected feature space by taking advantage of a set of representative features called visual words obtained using the bag-of-features model. Our main idea is to associate each image with a specific number of visual words to compose a bipartite graph, and then lay out the overall set of images using anchored map representation in which the ordering of anchor nodes is optimized through a genetic algorithm. For handling relatively large image datasets, we adaptively merge a pair of most similar images one by one to conduct the hierarchical clustering through the similarity measure based on the weighted Jaccard coefficient. Voronoi partitioning has been also incorporated into our approach so that we can visually identify the image categorization based on support vector machine. Experimental results are finally presented to demonstrate that our visualization framework can effectively elucidate the underlying relationships between images and visual words through the anchored map representation.",

However, detailed information is also important in data analysis. When several lines overlap or are close to one another, distinguishing detailed information of polyline crossings is difficult. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the problem of polyline crossing ambiguity by using data labels. We place different labels along various polylines to give cues for differentiation of lines. We bend the lines and optimize the arrangement of curved lines to provide space for clear visible labels. An energy system that models attractive and repulsive forces of lines is used to guide the search for optimized line arrangement. The experiments on several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Visual notations are most often implemented using the low level syntax of programming languages which is time consuming, error prone, difficult to maintain and hardly human-centric. In this paper we describe an alternative approach to generating visual notations using by-example model transformations. In our new approach, a semantic mapping between model and view is implemented using model transformations. The notations resulting from this approach can be reused by mapping varieties of input data to their model and can be composed into different visualisations. Our approach is implemented in the CONVErT framework and has been applied to many visualisation examples. Two case studies for visualising statistical charts and visualisation of traffic data are presented in this paper. A detailed user study of our approach for reusing notations and generating visualisations has been provided that shows good reusability and general acceptance of the novel approach.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of three-dimensional visual languages requires a wide range of conceptional and technical knowledge on issues for 3D graphics and textual language processing. Our generator framework DEViL3D incorporates such knowledge and supports the design of visual 3D languages and their implementation from high-level specifications. Such 3D languages arise from different modeling domains that make use of three-dimensional representations, e.g., the \"ball-and-stick\"models of molecules. The front-end of a 3D language implementation is a dedicated 3D graphical structure editor, which offers interaction and navigation techniques to construct programs in their domain. These techniques allow to manipulate the 3D program directly using operations to insert, move, and restructure objects. We have developed canned solutions for all such techniques that are encapsulated in visual patterns, which are provided by our generator. The designer of a particular 3D language only has to apply visual patterns to constructs of the abstract syntax, which defines the basic structure of the language. We have complemented our development with a usability study. Participants had to solve several tasks with different interaction or navigation techniques. The results partially indicate a significant advantage of one technique over another.",

Then, the corresponding sand manipulation actions are performed. Our system supports the common sand drawing functions, such as sand erosion, sand sand spilling, and sand leaking. To use hands to draw virtual sand on a drawing plane, we design four key gestures which enable drawing manipulation actions for sand. The basic idea is that the gesture of one hand controls the drawing action. The motion and gesture of the other hand controls the drawing position. Our preliminary experimental results show that our system enables sand drawing with bare hands using Kinect. A user study indicates our system is useful to sand art drawing.",

    "abstract": "End-user development (EUD) is receiving increasing attention, due to the necessity of frequent extensions and personalizations of applications. In particular, EUDWeb technologies have focused on the support of web development tasks which are generally perceived to be complex by end-user developers. However an area of neglect within current EUDWeb environments is the support for the specification and implementation of access control, although it is perceived as a particularly complex task. Thus, in this paper we propose an EUDWeb approach and tool for the specification and generation of web applications embedding access control mechanisms. We extended a previous mockup-based EUDWeb approach by introducing visual assistance mechanisms enabling the specification of role-based access control policies and their plugging within the application logic.",

Existing techniques mostly rely on node-links visualizations to represent the usage patterns as social networks. This work takes a different approach that provides interactive scatter-plot visualizations on classified and time-based data. By providing a flexible visualization that can provide different angles on the multidimensional and classified data, the analyst could have better understanding and insight on web user behavior compared to the traditional social network methods. The effectiveness of our method has been demonstrated with a case study on an online portal system for tracking passive physical activity, called Walk 2.0.",

The interface is intuitive to the blind user because the layout consists of a very few large targets and remains consistent throughout the application. The verbal command option provides another dimension for user-interface interaction. Twelve out of thirteen users found that Ember verbal command navigation was easier than using a traditional web browser. Ten out of thirteen users found it faster to use the Ember tactile method of navigation compared to a traditional web browser. The learning rate for both the tactile and verbal command methods was faster compared to the learning rate associated with a traditional web browser layout. Finally it was seen that five out of five users found it significantly faster to use the Ember keypad compared to the QWERTY keypad.",

Such distribution makes continuous collaboration and continuous awareness support a necessity and also a great challenge. Traditional desktop-based approaches are insufficient for the requirements of continuous awareness. In practical process of software development, an awareness tool on mobile devices is also desirable for team members to obtain the awareness information continuously. This paper addresses how to effectively present collaborative development activities using aesthetic visualization on mobile screens. Our approach supports multiple views suitable for software developers as well as team leaders. A small scale usability experiment has been conducted and reported.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an Information Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) intervention through a novel audio assisted mobile application, designed for low literate mothers in rural and sub-urban parts of Assam in India. It explores new methods to enhance the usability of ICTs by adopting the per-poor or grassroots level innovation model which facilitates the poor to innovate for themselves through their interpretation of existing technologies. Systematically harvesting grassroots innovation is gaining momentum and attracting ICT interventions due to the increasing availability of low cost personalized mobile phones. Following a user centred design approach, we designed an audio-visual based application for the Nokia 6303. This would impart maternal health care information to low literate mothers and provide them with easier access to government health care facilities. Our research and field work involved 24 participants and investigated new modes of disseminating maternal health care information without disrupting the existing government health care system. We explored usage of Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGAs) to redefine our layout from scratch and compared two methods of representing graphics- metaphorical icons and realistic visuals, observing significant preference for the latter. We found that grid based menu icons in small screen interfaces were more adaptable than a list based menu. To consolidate and validate the design proposed by us, we qualitatively tested a high fidelity prototype with 8 fresh participants. Our findings provide a possible systematic set of considerations that can be taken prior to realizing per-poor innovation in future ICT4Ds.",

These approaches are a positive step towards households becoming more environmentally conscious and in control of their energy usage, which is vitally important if greater energy use efficiency is to be achieved. This paper reviews the current state of research in domestic energy use visualisation from four perspectives: personal characteristics influencing and motivating behaviour of individuals; correctly informing the individual; the reality and effectiveness of feedback; and the utility and impact of social effects. An analysis of these four perspectives will further our understanding of how to create successful domestic energy use visualisations.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of how best to use colour in Euler diagrams. The choice of using coloured curves, rather than black curves, possibly with coloured fill is often made in tools that automatically draw Euler diagrams for information visualization as well as when they are drawn manually. We address the problem by empirically evaluating various different colour treatments: coloured or black curves combined with either no fill or coloured fill. By collecting performance data, we conclude that Euler diagrams with coloured curves and no fill significantly outperform all other colour treatments. Most automated layout algorithms adopt colour fill and are, thus, reducing the effectiveness of the Euler diagrams produced. As Euler diagrams can be used in a multitude of areas, ranging from crime control to social network analysis, our results stand to increase the ability of users to accurately and quickly extract information from their visualizations.",

A number of aesthetic criteria have been used in practice to guide the visualization process and judge the quality of graph drawings. These aesthetics are limited since they often conflict with each other. It is generally agreed that in order to make visualizations effective, well-grounded perception and cognitive theories and design principles are needed. Some attempts have been made to develop visualization theories. In this paper, we present a preliminary study which we conducted with a cognitive approach to add to this growing body of research. More specifically, we propose a graph visualization model, which is further conceptualized into a two-stage assessment cycle. Examples of potentially useful methodologies and theories are introduced and their implications for producing user-friendly visualizations are discussed.",

This is an interactive artwork and drawing tool for creative participant experiences. As is discussed, emergence is characteristically creative. It is also debated across and within disciplines, resulting in a range of understandings as well as models. This paper shows how one field's understanding of emergence (complexity theory) can be used to facilitate emergence in another domain (design research) and, importantly provide the opportunity for someone to act creatively. This paper begins with a brief review of some theories of emergence to show how they interrelate and can effect the perception of emergent structures in an observer, and, correspondingly, the design for creative experience. This is subsequently demonstrated in the second section of the paper where an interactive artwork and drawing application, Of me with me, is presented. This artwork by the author was created during collaboration with community artists from Cerebral Palsy League. The discussion covers the application of emergence theories to create this visualization in order facilitate the perception of structures and creative behaviours in a participant and to facilitate self-efficacy in the community artist user group.",

The hyperbolic tree can visualize large hierarchical structure. It allocates more space for the nodes of our concern, with the entire hierarchical structure being displayed at the same time. We utilize the time disc, which is similar to the spiral, to display the time-series data. Unlike traditional bar charts and line graphs, the time disc is suited to visualizing large data set and supporting much better the identification of features in the data, such as periodicity and trends. The method can easily display large hierarchical structure and time-series data. We visualize the time series data of each child node by selecting the parent node in the hyperbolic tree, and then observe the similarities and differences between the nodes and the trends of the thing. We applied this method to the urban air quality data visualization and achieved good results.",

    "abstract": "The global demographic shift of the proportion of ageing population is projected to be more than double in the next four decades. Consequently, healthcare systems will face strong demands from the increase in patients because the ageing population is prone to chronic diseases. A possible solution for some chronic diseases is to provide healthcare through in-home monitoring technology. However, current design considerations have a greater focus on how to deliver healthcare through these technologies than how the patients' experience the technologies. Hence, these technologies are often a digital version of the existing healthcare delivery system. This paper presents preliminary findings of a patient-technology study from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective. A HCI empirical evaluation was conducted of patients' use of technology in a telemedicine clinical trial of type 2 diabetes. This paper describes the Clinical User-Experience Evaluation (CUE) method that was designed for this trial to explore medical monitoring in the digital age. Preliminary findings about design of future patient-centric in-home monitoring technology for type 2 diabetes are presented.",

    "abstract": "Radial visualization continues to be a popular design choice in information visualization systems, due perhaps in part to its aesthetic appeal. However, it is an open question whether radial visualizations are truly more effective than their Cartesian counterparts. In this paper, we describe an initial user trial from an ongoing empirical study of the SQiRL (Simple Query interface with a Radial Layout) visualization system, which supports both radial and Cartesian projections of stacked bar charts. Participants were shown 20 diagrams employing a mixture of radial and Cartesian layouts and were asked to perform basic analysis on each. The participants' speed and accuracy for both visualization types were recorded. Our initial findings suggest that, in spite of the widely perceived advantages of Cartesian visualization over radial visualization, both forms of layout are, in fact, equally usable. Moreover, radial visualization may have a slight advantage over Cartesian for certain tasks. In a follow-on study, we plan to test users' ability to create, as well as read and interpret, radial and Cartesian diagrams in SQiRL.",

In addition to this, Shift functionality is provided to accommodate a larger set of characters. A webcam is positioned so as to monitor the keyboard and the characters are identified based on the laser pointer which the user can control by minor head movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the design achieves very promising results, thus establishing a baseline for such models in this domain.",

    "abstract": "The allocation of resources to manage invasive species is decided by multiple land managers. However, these decisions are commonly made without full knowledge of, and access to, information about the landscape beyond the immediate areas of interest. Consequently, many decisions on pest management are made without consideration of other invaded areas by individuals who may not appreciate the broader implications. Landscape scale modelling can be enhanced through high speed species dispersal modelling combined with table sized interactive visualisation technologies that can incorporate large volumes of spatial data to better inform the decision-making process. This paper presents a project that combines these modelling and visualisation technologies so multiple stakeholders can engage with, and assess, interactions simultaneously. Then, pest management decisions can be based on a wider ecological and economical perspective.",

Route planning for leisurely travel is an example of a problem in this class, where constraints including total available time, transit times, and budget constraints determine whether a potential solution is acceptable to the prospective traveller. In this paper we present an interface that leverages, metaphorically, the elastic properties of a rubber band to allow playful interaction with relevant constraints. The resulting touch-based human computer interface enables the traveller to explore the solution space in the sense that constraints can be played with in order to find a route that meets the traveller's subjective preferences. Formal step-by-step evaluation with nine subjects confirms that leveraging the rubber band metaphor is useful in constraint satisfaction and that using the interface is intuitive since it leverages real-world experiences.",

To maintain this order of photographs, our photomosaic generation technique firstly arranges the given set of photographs in the order of those times, and then retouches so that the set of photographs forms a photomosaic-like scene.

In many occasions, required information cannot be extracted from these videos due to the poor quality of the video or due to the large distance from camera to the interested object. A multiple image super resolution based technique to improve license plate regions in low quality videos has been proposed in this paper. Moreover, a two step image registration technique based on phase correlation method has been proposed to align multiple license plate image regions. The evaluation of the method was done based on an automatic number plate recognition system. The impact to the recognition rates of automatic number plate recognition system by using the proposed method is measured. Compressed, low quality, real traffic videos were used as the dataset. According to the results, a significant improvement of recognition rates achieved with the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate human motion tracking as a high dimensional constrained dynamic optimization problem. A novel generative method, called Sequential Immune Genetic Algorithm, is proposed for human motion tracking. The main contribution is that we introduce immune genetic algorithm (IGA) for pose optimization in latent space of human motion. As the latent space is low-dimensional and contains the prior knowledge of human motion, it makes pose analysis more efficient and accurate. We apply IGA for pose optimization. Compared with GA and other evolutionary methods, its main advantage is the ability to use the prior knowledge of human motion. As motion tracking is a dynamic optimization problem, we incorporate the temporal continuity information into the traditional IGA and propose a sequential IGA (S-IGA) algorithm. We demonstrate our methods on different videos of different motion types. Experimental results show that the S-IGA motion tracking method can achieve accurate and stable tracking of 3D human motion.",

    "abstract": "According to Google Trends, mobile augmented reality (AR) apps will, after a brief hype-associated peak and decline, show again a more steady growth in the near future. Indeed, a review of currently available mobile AR apps suggests that they are embracing practical uses instead of simply showing off the capabilities of AR. Many of these apps are making information more ubiquitous without making the user necessarily aware of the data's origins, using graphics to represent multiple datasets. There has been however little research focusing on the trends in AR and the types of data visualisations used in mobile AR. The purpose of this paper is to fill that void by presenting an analysis of currently popular mobile AR apps on the market. Our findings from this small-scale investigation give an indication of the types of visualisation styles used in current mobile AR apps and highlight suggestions for how to make the information presented more relevant, for example by using better filtering methods.",

Because of human's high sensitivity for facial expressions in many areas such as game, movie, avatars and social robot tries to mimic these facial expressions to their artificial human models to increase realistic feature. This paper proposes a novel methodology of combining ratio mapping technique and difference feature adding mechanism to generate facial expressions for mesh models in 3D space. A 3D point cloud data is taken as the input and preprocessing techniques such as spike removing and down sampling are applied to remove noise points and unwanted data points to improve the smoothness of construction model. Then a 2.5D mesh reconstruction algorithm is applied to generate a 3D face mesh. In the final stage proposed techniques applied to the generated face meshes.",

    "abstract": "Many solutions have been proposed for human action detection in the past. Even though, almost all the solutions address only the detection of basic human activities such as 'shaking hands', 'sitting down' etc and all of them are based on the structure of the activity pattern. No considerable attention has been paid to detect more semantic activities (more meaningful activities) like 'smoking', 'fighting', 'riding', etc. Therefore existing solutions are not capable of identifying such semantic activities accurately. There are three main reasons behind this inability. First one is most activities do not have any identifiable common action structure in it ('talking'). Secondly even when there is such an identifiable structure that activity pattern does not follow every single instance of activity performing ('smoking'). Third reason is some activities are too complex to identify using such basic action pattern analyses approaches ('hurdling'). Nevertheless ultimate expectation of human activity detection is identifying more complex/meaningful activities. Therefore, it is essential to address this problem properly for implementation of more useful applications in the future. In this paper, we urge the importance of using contextual information associated with semantic activities to overcome above mentioned three problems.",

Visual information is affected to the consumer appetite. This study was focused on store lighting at supermarkets, aimed to digitalize and quantify the effects of the visibility on foods. From this result, it had been clarified that the optimum color temperature for each food were variant. Lighting with the optimum color temperature can make enhance the feature of food. Therefore, improvement of visibility was raised consumer appetite.",

Since the investigation is led by local communities, it is not possible to anticipate which data will be relevant and what questions are going to be asked. Therefore, users have to be able to construct and tailor visualisations to their own needs. The poster presents early work towards defining a suitable compositional model, which will allow users to mix, match, and manipulate data sets to obtain visual representations with little-to-no programming knowledge. Following a user-centred design process, we are subsequently planning to identify appropriate interaction techniques and metaphors for generating such visual specifications on wall-sized, multi-touch displays.",

    "abstract": "Infovis (Information visualization) task taxonomy plays an essential role in guiding Infovis design and implementation. Infovis users with various roles in Infovis usually have different requirements for Infovis task modeling. Actually, Infovis research need a consistent taxonomy covering the tasks at different levels, or an interaction model that can facilitate Infovis system development with formal descriptions. But in fact, finding such a unified model is challenging. In this paper we propose a multilevel interaction model (MIM) for hierarchical tasks in Infovis systems. In MIM we define goal model, behavior model, and operation model that can model multilevel tasks in Infovis. In addition, we establish mapping models among MIM components, which can support Infovis systems design, development, application, and evaluation. Finally, we present a domain-specific Infovis application modeled by MIM. Application examples shows that MIM can effectively model multilevel tasks in Infovis and has potential to provide a framework enabling rapid prototyping of Infovis systems.",

    "abstract": "Due to problems in correctly understanding user requirements the Information System (IS) development community have recognised the need to involve end-users in the development and maintenance of web applications. End-users perceive web applications through user interfaces (UIs) and commonly use sketches of UIs to express their requirements. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an end-user development methodology centred on UI modelling techniques. In this paper a visual modelling approach is presented to empower end-users in developing data intensive web applications starting from user interface descriptions. The modelling language follows a holistic approach by representing both static and behavioural information of a web application in one visual model. The visual model allows the specification of the look-and-feel of the application through mock-ups, and the user interactions through links, annotations, and widget references. End-users are guided during the modelling process by providing a summary view to manage the design of complex applications and a data model view to improve the quality of the generated applications.",

    "abstract": "The visualization of complex physical processes is becoming a challenging topic in fields of information visualization, and attracting more and more researchers. Microstructure evolution visualization (MEV) has become an important and unsubstitutable method in the modern material processing engineering domains. A novel MEV approach combining the neutrosophic set theory (NS) and the cellular automaton technique (CA) is developed in order to precisely simulate the invisible, complex and unrepeatable physical process of metal solidification. The NS theory is applied to realize the complex evolution rules among three phases including solid phase, liquid phase and interface phase, while the CA method is used to simulate the dynamic process of dendrite growth. Experiment results of the dendrite growing simulation show strange consistency of the virtual invisible microstructure with that in practical industrial trials and production. Material experts also convince the statistical characteristics of the simulation results and further the inspirational value for the visualization of other complex physical processes.",

The method introduces an interactive straight prismatic construction space to realize the structure and shape variation of the example model simultaneously. The construction space defines the global size and the local shape feature of the desired model. Users can draw a closed curve and some skeleton lines by a sketch-based interface to design the construction space. Our algorithm first uses a quadrangulation algorithm to create a subdivision plane with the same contour as the closed curve. And the drawn skeleton lines control the local orientation of split units in the plane. Then it creates the construction space by sweeping the subdivision plane. Finally, it fills the construction space with the deformed model pieces while maintaining the generalized adjacent constraints, which are defined according to the example model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on large-scale complex models such as architecture, mountains.",

    "abstract": "As a novel type of real-time social networking service, microblogging has already become ubiquitous and an irreplaceable tool. Tracking in the pulse of retweeting propagation is important and meaningful. In this paper, we investigate how information propagation in a specific microblogging platform evolves to identify relevant patterns and understand dynamic attributes of information propagation and the underlying sociological motivations. More specifically, based on the node-link diagram, we propose three efficient strategies to map the multiple attributes of information propagation graph to appropriate visual elements. For revealing the dynamic attributes, we propose two models: the depth-varying and the time-varying parallel data model to illustrate the temporal evolution efficiently. We also present a novel method by combining the traditional scatter plot with Hough transformation to represent the distribution of propagation instances and trace the propagation speeds. We integrate our methods to a visual mining tool and develop several interactive features. We demonstrate how our approaches improve the understanding of the propagation graph from a visual perspective by employing propagation datasets collected from Sina Weibo, the largest microblogging service provider in mainland China. Meanwhile, this visual mining tool has been evaluated by data analysts and successfully used in Sina Corporation as a helpful assistant to them.",

However, the culture influence on people's aesthetic perception and experience has not been systematically explored. In the first part of our study, we measured the eye movements of Chinese and western participants while they viewed Chinese traditional Ink-wash paintings, and we found that the Chinese participants had longer fixation time in the white space areas than did the western participants. In the second part of the study, we measured their eye movements while they viewed different paintings composed by the linear perspective or scattered perspective techniques, and the results suggest that the western participants are more sensitive to the perspective difference between paintings. The findings contribute to the understanding of culture influence on people's aesthetic perception of visual art and visual communication.",

Similar to Treemap techniques, it uses enclosure to divide display space into smaller areas for its sub-hierarchies. The algorithm can partition a polygonal shape or even an arbitrary shape into smaller polygons, rotated rectangles or vertical-horizontal rectangles. The proposed method and implementation algorithms provide an effective interactive visualization tool for partitioning large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. We demonstrated the effective of the new method with a case study, an automated evaluation and a usability study.",

Recently geographic maps have been used as a metaphor for visualization, given that most people are familiar with reading maps, and several visualization methods based on this metaphor have been developed. In this paper we present a new visualization method that aims to improve on existing map-like visualizations. It is based on the metaphor of liquids poured onto a surface that expand outwards until they touch each other, forming larger areas. We present the design of our visualization method and an evaluation we have carried out to compare it with an existing visualization. Our new visualization has better usability, leading to higher accuracy and greater speed of task performance.",

Firstly, different views' features are extracted by unsupervised feature learning. Then classifiers are trained to evaluate each view's discrimination ability. A view with the best classifier has the best discrimination ability, and it is chosen as the best view of the 3D model. At last, experiments show that 3D models of same class have similar best views.",

Then, with a similarity measure between Open datasets, we use the Relative Neighbors method for building a proximity graph between datasets. We use a force-directed layout method to visualize the graph (Tulip Software). We present the results with a collection of 300,000 datasets from the French Open data web site, in which the display of the graph is limited to 150,000 datasets. We study the discovered clusters and we show how they can be used to browse this large collection.",

When chairs can record and communicate details about sitting, sidewalks make suggestions about walking, and shavers monitor diet, interesting opportunities will arise for designers to generate new affordances based on the data. However, for many designers, the process of understanding the numbers available in the spreadsheets and databases may prove prohibitive, unless new methods are developed for showing relevance while not losing track of the underlying information. In this presentation, I propose a new genre of \"data stories,\" where the goal is to create narratives that are anchored in big data, but provide a form of shared experience that can be used to both shape design ideas and communicate their potential significance.",

    "abstract": "Information graphics have been used for thousands of years to help illustrate ideas and communicate information. However, it requires skills and time to hand craft high-quality, customized information graphics for specific situations (e.g., data characteristics and user tasks). The problem becomes more acute when we must deal with big data. To address this problem, we are researching and developing mixed-initiative visual analytic systems that leverage both the intelligence of humans and machines to aid users in deriving insights from massive data. On the one hand, such a system automatically guides users to perform their data analytic tasks by recommending suitable visualization and discovery paths in context. On the other hand, users interactively explore, verify, and improve visual analytic results, which in turn helps the system to learn from users' behavior and improve its quality over time. In this talk, I will present key technologies that we have developed in building mixed-initiative visual analytic systems, including feature-based visualization recommendation and optimization-based approaches to dynamic data transformation for more effective visualization. I will also use concrete applications to demonstrate the use and value of mixed-initiative visual analytic systems, and discuss existing challenges and future directions in this area.",

    "abstract": "Visual information, in particular in form of images, is becoming increasingly important, and consequently efficient and effective tools for managing these rapidly growing collections are highly sought after. Interactive image database browsing systems provide an interesting alternative to retrieval-based approaches as they let the user explore an image dataset in an intuitive fashion. Based on content-based concepts, large image collections are visualised so that visually similar images are located close in the visualisation space. Once an image collection is displayed, the user is then given the opportunity to interactively explore it through various browsing operations. In my talk, I will highlight the three main approaches to visualising image databases, namely mapping-based, clustering-based and graph-based visualisations and will then present some of the systems that we have developed in our lab for this purpose, such as the Hue Sphere Image Browser, the Honeycomb Image Browser and their recent ports to large multi-touch screen environments and mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "The framework of Texture-by-numbers (TBN) synthesizes images of global-varying patterns with intuitive user control. Previous TBN synthesis methods have difficulties in achieving high-quality synthesis results and efficiency simultaneously. This paper proposes a fast TBN synthesis method based on texture optimization, which uses global optimization to solve the controllable non-homogeneous texture synthesis problem. Our algorithm produces high quality synthesis results by combining texture optimization into TBN framework with two improvements. The initialization process is adopted to generate the initial output of the global optimization algorithm, which speeds up the algorithm's convergence rate and ensures synthesis quality. Besides different metrics to measure image similarity are defined to match human visual perception better. To further improve the synthesis speed, the algorithm is entirely implemented on GPU based on CUDA architecture. The experimental results show that this method synthesizes realistic images with high efficiency, which is not only applicable to the traditional TBN application, but also suitable for other applications including non- photorealistic rendering and image in-painting.",

    "abstract": "Network security depends heavily on automated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to sense malicious activities. Unfortunately, IDS often generates both too much raw information and a large number of false positive alerts. Information visualization research has been performed to help users discover and analyze information through visual exploration efficiently. Even with the aid of visualization, identifying the attack patterns and recognizing the false positives from a great number of alerts are still challenges. In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework for IDS alerts that can monitor the network and perceive the overall view of the security situation using radial graph in real-time. The framework utilizes five categories of entropy functions to quantitatively analyze the irregular behavioral patterns, and synthesizes interactions, filtering and drill-down to detect the potential intrusions. In conclusion, we describe how this framework was used to analyze the mini-challenges of the 2011 and 2012 VAST challenge.",

But are there are other socioeconomic factors that influence disease incidence as well? In this paper, we introduce a visualization tool called Disease Trends that explores the associations and possible correlations between specific economic (personal income per capita), educational (percentage of adult population with a four year college degree), and environmental (air pollution level) factors with diabetes prevalence and cancer incidence rates across counties throughout the United States. It is structured as an interactive geographical visualization that displays disease incidence data as an interactive choropleth map and connects it with coordinated views of the socioeconomic variables for each county as the user scrolls over it. Additionally, the ability to compare and contrast counties as well as to interactively specify a region for comparison allows further examination of the data. This results in an informative overview of disease incidence trends that allows users to spot areas of interest and potentially pursue these areas further with more scientific research.",

    "abstract": "News articles have become an important data source for the general public and researchers. We have developed an interactive visual analytics tool for news exploration (NewsVAT). It includes four main components: preprocessing, analysis, visualization engine and an interface for news exploration. NewsVAT takes news articles as input, and outputs animations reflecting the content of these documents. It provides time series visualization, spatial visualization, co-occurrence network, etc. Rich, flexible and interactive visualization is the prominent feature. In order to test the effectiveness of NewsVAT, a case study was conducted which partly proves the system is effective in news exploration and a helpful aid to research work. Further development includes refining the interactive visualization and improving the accuracy of automatic extraction.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a time line visualization approach, which allows users to study temporal relationships through encoding their interested data properties to time lines with different shapes and locations. Specifically, our approach extracts key data features as virtual words and uses them to encode various data properties. The distributions of virtual words across time are further applied to study various temporal relationships by generating time lines, which renders sampled time steps as points and temporal sequence as a line. Our approach consists of the three following components. First, we select feature points and collect feature descriptors to build a space of data properties, where virtual words are extracted as representative vectors. Second, the virtual words are applied to characterize feature points and their distribution statistics are used to measure temporal relationships. Third, we present several case studies to visualize time lines for different data visualization and analysis purposes. Our time line visualization can be used for both summarization and exploration of overall temporal relationships. We demonstrate with examples that time lines can serve as effective exploration, comparison, and visualization tools to study time-varying datasets.",

This paper proposes a novel method of entity extracting to perform the multi-scale and hierarchical visualization of multi-attribute data set. Firstly, the relationship between these characters can be expressed as entity-relationship and data dimension is expressed as entity attributes, which can eliminate data redundancy and reduce data dimensions. Then a scalable dynamic visualization mode is proposed to show the characters at different levels of details. The method can interactively operate to visualize different data sets, such as electronic commerce data, weather forecast data, and gene expressions data, generating effective visualization results.",

    "abstract": "Irregular needling embroidery has a very high artistic value as a Changzhou craftwork. Artists use stitches of rich colors and apply different types of stitch categories from course to fine on multiple layers to express objects. This paper proposes an irregular needling embroidery rendering method based on image. We first decompose the image into different regions, vector fields and image detail information to guild the subsequent simulation process. Then we hierarchically render the image with a series of layers and propose a multilayer rendering technique. Additionally, we build a stitch dictionary and present a method to simulate the threads. Experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper transfers reference images quickly and efficiently into their irregular needling embroidery simulations.",

With the increasing complexity and volume of dynamic networks, it is important to adopt strategies of joint decision-making through developing collaborative visualization approaches. In this paper, we present a formal user study to evaluate how paired users collaborate under co-located and distributed collaboration environments to tackle the problems of intrusion detection. Ten paired participants are requested to use network visualization patterns to identify attacks existed in the datasets. We observe participants behaviors and collect their performances from the aspects of coordination and communication, which include prioritizing goals and directions, dividing and balancing workloads, and negotiating analysis decisions while maintaining situational awareness. Based on the results, we conclude several coordination strategies and summarize the values of communication for collaborative detection. We also discuss human-related factors in the process of joint decision-making. Our study provides useful information for future design and development of collaborative visualization systems.",

The initial Chinese UX Questionnaire was based on a widely used English questionnaire, AttracDiff, proposed and refined by Hassenzahl and his colleagues, but extended with an additional dimension and several new items received from the interviews of Chinese users. We also conducted a study of applying the initial questionnaire for accessing the user experience of interacting three different mobile phones involved with thirty-six Chinese participants. We applied both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis on the items with good item-total correlations. The result showed that three factors or dimensions were identified: Hedonic Quality (Stimulation), Pragmatic Quality, and Conformity, as compared to the four dimensions in the AttracDiff. This confirmed our initial hypothesis that cultures not only influence people's cognition, but also affect their experience of interacting with products. We also discuss the future steps for refining the Chinese UX Questionnaire.",

We focus on business analysts and asset managers, who work collaboratively to analyze information and make decisions. Through extensive investigations in two organizational environments, we found that these users struggle with managing and analyzing information from multiple perspectives. Their current tools lack support for aggregating, organizing, and sharing such information. To address their needs, we characterized their analytic workflows, extracted specific key knowledge actions for each task commonly found in these workflows, and designed and evaluated two visual analytics systems that support and encapsulate these knowledge actions. We provide design guidelines that should be used when designing visual analytics systems, and illustrate their effectiveness with two systems built by following them.",

    "abstract": "Along with the rapid development of information technology, individual users of computers are faced with many problems in dealing with massive files, such as enormous amount, serious redundancy and complex version evolution relation. These lead that the file system becomes more and more rough-and-tumble, to a certain extent putting users to trouble in daily work. This paper systematically analyzed the problems in file system management, put forward user cognitive model when faced with massive files, and then introduced the FDTVAS system which is a visual interface based on hyperbolic tree view for exploring the massive files. This system used specific algorithm to do the intelligent analysis of file relationship, took hyperbolic tree as the main visual form, and provided a series of interaction tasks according with users' cognitive model. The built system can help users get a clear insight of the file system and do the analysis and management efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Recently, pen tilting has been explored in pen-based user interfaces and has shown potential to improve user interaction in various tasks (e.g., menu selection, modeless object manipulation). However, some basic questions concerning pen tilting behaviors, such as the ideal range, azimuth size, and direction of pen tilting, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we report our empirical studies on user performances in basic pen tilting tasks. First, we conducted a baseline study, which helps us to determine tilting directions, tilting ranges, and the thresholds that separate incidental pen tilting actions from intentional actions used for interaction. Based on the results from the baseline study, we designed an experiment to investigate user performances in goal tilting in different tilting ranges, azimuth sizes, and directions. Drawing on the results of our data analyses on task completion time, error rate, and pen tip movements, we discussed values of tilting parameters like titling range, minimal azimuth size, and tilting direction.",

We present here a formalisation of this class of languages, which we call Controlled Dataflow. This work was motivated by a previous study of an exceptions mechanism for visual languages of this type, since to define how the exceptions mechanism could be incorporated into any CDL, we needed a formalism to precisely capture the syntax and semantics of this class, including a protocol for including language-specific control structures. To illustrate the formalism, we provide an example that shows how it captures conditional execution and iteration. We also report on use of this formalism as the basis for an implementation of new CDL language tools.",

As a software visualization work, our approach is focused on both static structure of the Rete network and dynamic behavior of the inference process. Since logic programming is distinct from other traditional programming paradigms, our approach is also different from traditional program/algorithm visualization methods. In this paper, we first introduce the target we choose to visualize, and then provide a description of the problem and our visualization approach. Finally, with an implementation and an interesting case -- sudoku solving, we show that the visualization work is helpful to understanding not only the Rete algorithm, but also the rules used in the inference. Besides, our work supports debugging, tracing and analyzing the rule engine, which is useful in finding errors and optimization.",

In this visualization, the dimensions of data in n-dimensional space are mapped to n concentric circular axes drawn in a planar space with polar coordinates. A data item in n-dimensional space is represented as a poly-curve with n vertices across all circular axes. Via the spatial distortion in polar system, the view of multi-dimensional data is interactively adjusted to satisfy viewer's interest. The viewer, thus, can effectively navigate the underlying visual pattern to reach the great detail for uncovering trends and patterns in the visualization. One novelties of this work is performing focus+context viewing in polar coordinate system.",

    "abstract": "The large amount of phone call records from mobile operators in a city can inform us how many people are present in any given area and how many are entering or leaving. Each phone call record usually contains the caller and callee IDs, date and time, and the base station where the phone calls are made. As mobile phones are widely used in our daily life, many human behaviors can be revealed by analyzing mobile phone data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive visual analysis system which can be used to analyze the population's mobility patterns from millions of phone call records. Our system consists of three major components: 1) visual analysis of user groups in a base station; 2) visual analysis of the mobility patterns on different user groups making phone calls in certain base stations; 3) visual analysis of handoff phone call records. Some well-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and pixel-based representations have been integrated into our system. We also develop a novel visualization schemes, Voronoi-diagram-based visual encoding to reveal the unique features of mobile phone data. We have applied our system to real mobile phone data collected in a large city and obtained some interesting findings regarding people's mobility pattern.",

In this paper we present a novel fuzzy logic method to automatically generate the description of spatial relationships among objects. A new graph-based fuzzy linguistic metadata schema named Snowflake is proposed to describe the topology and metric relationships for a set of objects. Like an artist painting a picture, Snowflake selects one reference object to present the spatial relationships of all the other objects with respect to this reference object. This paper introduces the operations and isomorphism of Snowflake. The paper also demonstrates that Snowflake preserves the rotation invariance and the scale invariance of spatial relationships. Experiments show that Snowflake is an efficient and effective spatial modeling method.",

    "abstract": "Friend recommendation is popular in social network services to help people make new friends and expand their networks. Friend recommendation is either based on topological structures of a social network, or derived from profile information of users. However, dynamically recommending friends by considering both social connections and a context of social connections (e.g., similar interest) in a way of visual exploration is not well supported by existing tools. In this paper, we propose a novel visual system, SFViz (Social Friends Visualization), to support users to explore and find friends interactively under a context of interest. Our approach leverages both semantic structure of activity data and topological structures in social networks. In SFViz, a hierarchical structure of social tags is generated to help users navigate through a network of interest. Multiscale and cross-scale aggregations of similarity among people are presented in the hierarchy to support users to seek potential friends. We report a case study using SFViz to explore the recommended friends based on people's tagging behaviors in a music community, Last.fm. The results indicate that our system can enhance users' awareness of their social networks under different interest contexts, and help users seek potential friends sharing similar interests in an interactive way.",

For good and for ill, our professional, personal, and social activities are increasingly dependent on and intertwined with digital computation and communication facilities. Visual interfaces through which we typically interact with such systems date from Ivan Sutherland's seminal Sketchpad system in the 60's and now are commonplace on devices ranging from phones to ultrahigh resolution display walls. Interfaces continue to be a main focus of HCI and information visualization research and applications. In this talk I argue that focusing on the interface is only one of multiple important and necessary levels of design to support information-based activities and unless we attend more seriously to social, cognitive, and embodied levels, we will continue to fall far short of realizing the full potential of computer technology to aid thought, communication, and social interaction.",

This is true on the web, which has become a major source of information to learn about a topic, and it is also true in a research environment, where the amount of scientific material available electronically is forever increasing, making reading the published literature a difficult task. While reading a document, people often encounter a promising link (or citation), which they decide to follow, only to discover after a quick browse that the document is not relevant to their current needs. Often, people open the linked document into a new tabbed window to which they return later. In such cases, users usually have many tabs opened. When they finally get to the linked documents to read them, they sometimes wonder why they opened these documents in the first place.",

Sketch-based design technology has the potential to create a seamless transition from conceptual design to a manufactured product. This talk will present an overview on 2D sketch-based interface and modelling pipelines: stroke filtering and processing, 2D tidy-up, visual perception, 3D understanding and modelling. The talk will also review 3D sketch-based interfaces for modelling and interaction: 3D sketching with VR perceptions, 3D sketch with gesture tracking and mixed design environments. The talk will finally discuss the challenges ahead and implications in conceptual design.",

    "abstract": "Streamline based method is one of the most important vector field visualization methods. In the past streamline placements algorithms, little physical related feature was considered, which is very important in our opinion. A novel streamline placement algorithm for 3D vector field is introduced in this paper. We measure the difference between the inflow and the outflow to evaluate the local spatial-varying feature at a specified field point. A Difference of Inflow and Outflow Matrix (DIOM) is then calculated to describe the global appearance of the field. We draw streamlines by choosing the local extreme points in DIOM as seeds. DIOM is somewhat like flow divergence and is physics-related thus re-flects intrinsic characteristics of the vector field. The strategy performs well in revealing features of the vector field even with relatively few streamlines both in 3D vector field",

    "abstract": "BP neural network is an important part of neural network, and is broadly used in many areas. For BP neural network it's essential to learn a lot of training samples. However, the dataset of the training samples is so large and multi-dimensional that traditional techniques can't convey them effectively in a relative small display area. To address this problem, a parallel coordinates-based BP network visualization technique is proposed. In this approach, the parallel coordinates is constructed according to the model of BP neural network. In particular, clusters, colors, size, density and other features are used to improve the parallel coordinates to create clear intelligible visualization. At last, an experiment is designed to argue that parallel coordinates-based BP network visualization is feasible and effective, and can reveal the relations and rules hidden in the training samples in the process of the training.",

Then parallel coordinates with column-based cluster, bar axis density and other techniques is used to convey a large complex multi-dimensional dataset in a relative small screen through the following steps: (a) visualization of column-based clusters with user-defined granularity to simplify the corresponding dimension where we group all the data points into several discrete values; (b) several distinct colors to distinguish the lines contain different amount of data points; (c) opacity is introduced to visualization to tell the difference among the lines with the same color; (d) brand instead of polyline to reveal the centre and the extent of each cluster; (e) layer-based drawing technique to emphasize the heavy lines and to denote the trend of multi-dimensional datasets; (f) bar axis to provide special space to illustrate the density of the dataset on each axis. Anyway, our work has two primary goals: one is to convey large dataset with legible compact vivid visualization on a limited screen area.

    "abstract": "Recent research has indicated that human graph reading performance can be affected by the size of crossing angle. Crossing angle is closely related to another aesthetic criterion: number of edge crossings. Although crossing number has been previously identified as the most important aesthetic, its relative impact on performance of human graph reading is unknown, compared to crossing angle. In this paper, we present an exploratory user study investigating the relative importance between crossing number and crossing angle. This study also aims to further examine the effects of crossing number and crossing angle not only on task performance measured as response time and accuracy, but also on cognitive load and visualization efficiency. The experimental results reinforce the previous findings of the effects of the two aesthetics on graph comprehension. The study demonstrates that on average these two closely related aesthetics together explain 33% of variance in the four usability measures: time, accuracy, mental effort and visualization efficiency, with about 38% of the explained variance being attributed to the crossing angle.",

    "abstract": "The diff utility is an important basic tool, providing a foundation for many of the fundamental practices of software development, such as source code management. While there are many file differencing tools for textual programming languages, including some that look at more than simple textual variations, there are few for visual programming languages. We present an algorithm for semantic comparison of programs in controlled visual dataflow languages; that is, languages in which dataflow diagrams are embedded in control structures. This algorithm performs depth-first search of call structures comparing embedded diagrams using subgraph isomorphism, to determine if two programs are semantically equivalent, and if they are not, discovers the differences. We use the visual language Prograph for illustration; however, the mechanism we propose could be applied to any controlled dataflow language, such as LabVIEW.",

In this paper, we present the framework for creating and modifying a concept map that allows analysts to collaborate and utilize live collection of enterprise data in a visual interface. Based on modeling users and tasks in visual analysis, a user model supporting collaborative analysis is given. Furthermore, we propose the algorithm of concept map layout to facilitate the visual analysis. The interface presents the analyst with the dashboard configuration of certain data that users deems relevant, provides tools to facilitate the decision making process. Finally, we apply it to a collaborative visual decision support system. Experimental results show that it enhances the accessibility and the individualization of collaborative concept map for configuring enterprise data and helps to enhance user experience during the visual analysis process.",

One of such resources is a set of discourse strategies, the abstract structures that specify how to construct a coherent text to achieve a specific communicative goal. Discourse strategies, however, prove to be difficult to develop, in part due to their abstractness. In this paper, we describe a graphical tool which allows users to annotate documents to indicate its various elements and how they relate to each other. The annotations can then be used to generate a first draft of the discourse strategies automatically. The tool is presented in the context of the Myriad delivery platform which aims at facilitating the rapid development of tailored information delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Social tags reflect personal and shared vocabulary, and provide opportunities for people to organize and search information. However, tags are usually not structured. To find relevant tags and associated documents, people often need to invest significant amount of cognitive resources to make sense of the relationships among tags. To help the sensemaking of social tags and exploration of knowledge structure of them, we propose an approach of tag networks, TagNet, in which tags are linked by their corresponding documents and a multiscale tag hierarchy are derived with network clustering and aggregation techniques. We also present TagNetLens, an interactive tool that allows users to explore a tag network and its tag hierarchy. We report a case study of TagNet and TagNetLens based on social tags and documents from CiteULike. The results indicate that our TagNet approach can provide users with knowledge structures that are similar to cognitive structures of concepts in people's minds, and TagNetLens can help people to better explore the space of social tags and may have potentials to facilitate the understanding of the knowledge structure in social tags.",

Effective and efficient search on the web is a key challenge. In this paper we propose a system for web search based on the visual structure (layout and colors) of web pages. Considering that interpretation of visual structures depends on individual perceptual characteristics, the creator and the searcher both participate in a session of expressing their own interpretation of layout and colors of a target web page. Web search is carried out by evaluating similarities between those visual page structures. This search scheme will help people to organize richer social networks with consideration of user's sensibility and preference to visual structural features.",

However, current link analysis tools commonly used in detection do not utilize such patterns for detecting various types of crimes. These analysis tools usually provide generic functions for all types of crimes and heavily rely on the user's expertise on the domain knowledge of the crime for successful detection. As a result, they are less effective in detecting patterns in certain crimes. In addition, substantial effort is also required for analyzing vast amount of crime data and visualizing the structural views of the entire criminal network. In order to alleviate these problems, an event-based approach to money laundering data analysis and visualization is proposed in this paper.

Mobil applications place special constraints that challenge the existing ways of visual analytic design where relatively stable and interaction-rich contexts are assumed. In tasks like learning unfamiliar places, current visualizations on mobile devices are not capable of helping users to form a good cognitive map of the environment. How can we take advantage of rich physical environmental cues and supplement with computational power to help people make sense of the environment? In this paper, we present a framework of sensemaking to model how people get insight into the environment as they navigate around. Based on this framework, we present design guidelines for mobile visual analytics that could enhance the spatial awareness of the navigator and analyze several existing designs through the discussion.",

To reach a good outcome, it is important to learn how to combine the different concepts from all the related disciplines and to understand what the no-goes are to avoid possible design flaws that hinder a data explorer at solving the tasks at hand. In particular, the newcomers in information visualization have to be taught to follow the rules in visualization, human-computer interaction, but even more the well-known and established design criteria to avoid the same mistakes as others did before. In this paper we describe a teaching concept to guide bachelor students with nearly no experience in information visualization to design their own visual interfaces focusing on data visualization problems. We illustrate the results from the course in several application examples showcasing the visual designs that students came up with.",

However, non-experts in the field of visual data analysis often have problems with correctly reading and interpreting information from visualization idioms that are new to them. To make new forms of visualizations understandable and interpretable for a broad range of audiences, visualization onboarding methods can support users. However, it is unclear whether concrete or abstract materials yield better results to foster learning. In order to answer this question, we conducted a within-subject study with 40 students to compare abstract and concrete onboarding messages for a treemap visualization. The results show that (1) concrete onboarding messages are more helpful than abstract, whereas the length of the abstract messages is ranked higher; (2) abstract onboarding messages lead to more valuable descriptions; and (3) either concrete or abstract onboarding messages can lead to high valuable insights.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view visualizations are typically presented in a grid layout with elements positioned according to their bounding rectangles. These rectangles often contain unused white space. In cases where Tufte’s Shrink Principle can be applied to reduce non-data-ink without impairing the communication of information, unused white space can be utilized for the placement of other elements. This is often done in manually “hand-crafted” layouts by designers. However, upon changes to individual elements, this design process has to be repeated. To reduce non-data-ink and repetitive manual design, we contribute a method for automatically turning a grid layout into a content-driven layout, where elements are positioned with respect to their contents. Existing approaches have explored the use of a force simulation in conjunction with proxy geometries to simplify collision handling for irregular shapes. Such customized force directed layouts are usually unstable, and often require additional constraints to run properly. In addition, proxy geometries become less accurate and effective with more irregular shapes. To solve these shortcomings, we contribute an approach for identifying central elements in an original grid layout in order to set up corresponding attractive forces. Furthermore, we utilize an image-based approach for collision detection and avoidance that works accurately for highly irregular shapes. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with three case studies.",

    "abstract": "Color is one of the fundamental elements of paintings. This paper proposes a set of measurements for color usage in a painting, including basic color elements, color harmony templates, and spatial distribution, characterizing both global and local features of color. Applying the measurements to over 3000 abstract paintings, oil paintings and Chinese ink paintings, we are able to observe the roles of color in the three genres of paintings. We report our findings in details on the effectiveness of these measurements, which may serve as tools for classification of paintings. The work is the first of this kind and points to further investigation of color usage in other forms of art and design.",

The experiment was conducted using prefectures in Japan as objective concepts and participants were asked whether they could identify a prefecture from its deformed contour and whether it matched their image of the prefecture. The results of the online web-based experiment yielded an average of 26-27 responses per prefecture. Based on the analysis of the results, the contours of prefectures are divided into those with and without local features. Furthermore, as local features, “spikes” with an area ratio above a certain level and a vertex angle below a certain level influenced the preservation of mental images.",

Group Diagrams consist of trajectory subsets that cover, or represent, the whole set of trajectories with respect to some distance measure and an adjustable distance threshold. The original GDs allow for an application of various distance measures. We implement the GD framework and evaluate it on scanpaths that were collected by a former user study on public transit maps. We find that the Fréchet distance is the most appropriate measure to get meaningful results, yet it is flexible enough to cover outliers. We discuss several implementation-specific challenges and improve the scalability of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Data visualization relies on efficient rendering to allow users to interactively explore and understand their data. However, achieving interactive frame rates is often challenging, especially for high-resolution displays or large datasets. In computer graphics, several methods temporally reconstruct full-resolution images from multiple consecutive lower-resolution frames. Besides providing temporal image stability, they amortize the rendering costs over multiple frames and thus improve the minimum frame rate. We present a method that adopts this idea to accelerate 2D information visualization, without requiring any changes to the rendering itself. By exploiting properties of orthographic projection, our method significantly improves rendering performance while minimizing the loss of image quality during camera manipulation. For static scenes, it quickly converges to the full-resolution image. We discuss the characteristics of our method concerning rendering performance and image quality and the corresponding trade-offs. Finally, we present extensive rendering benchmarks to examine real-world performance for examples of parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrix visualizations, and discuss appropriate application scenarios and contraindications for usage.",

Tumor sub-regions may play a critical role in defining tumor types and may hold essential information about tumor aggressiveness. Depending on the tumor’s location within the body, such sub-regions can be easily identified and determined by physiology, but these sub-regions are not readily visible to others. Regions within a tumor are currently explored by comparing the image sequences and analyzing the tissue heterogeneity present. To improve the exploration of such tumor sub-regions, we propose a visual analytics tool called ICEVis. ICEVis supports the identification of tumor sub-regions and corresponding features combined with cluster visualizations highlighting cluster validity. It is often difficult to estimate the optimal number of clusters; we provide rich facilities to support this task, incorporating various statistical measures and interactive exploration of the results. We evaluated our tool with three clinical researchers to show the potential of our approach.",

Helping uncover and understand the hidden patterns behind the occurrence of Earthquakes is vital for preparation and emergency response. Unfortunately, it is difficult to do so as those patterns probably depend on too many variables to be easily perceived with common visualization techniques. In this paper we expand on a technique designed for eye movement data and apply it to spatio-temporal earthquake events. This visualization combines the spatial and temporal dimension into a line-based splatted diagram that provides an overview and serves as a starting point for further data explorations in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Statistical graphs are becoming common in many fields. Modern authoring tools offer easy ways to create complex graphs. Despite multiple sources of advice, graph designers have little objective evidence on which to base design decisions to alleviate complexity. We aimed to fill a gap in the evidence of the difficulty created by two design features: adding one data series to a simple graph or adding dependent axes to a graph. We found main effects of adding a data series, of a greater number of data points, and an additional dependent axis, but primarily on the time readers studied the graph. Via deeper analysis, we explained the difficulty graph readers experienced when answering questions. That explanation focuses on the selection of points from a source graph to be part of the query. Based on our results, we recommend avenues for research on graph complexity and graph comprehension measurement.",

    "abstract": "Authoring situated visualizations in-situ is challenging due to the need of writing code in a mobile and highly dynamic fashion. To provide better support for that, we define requirements for text input methods that target situated visualization authoring. We identify wearable chorded keyboards as a potentially suitable method that fulfills some of these requirements. To further investigate this approach, we tailored a chorded keyboard device to visualization authoring, developed a learning application, and conducted a pilot user study. Our results confirm that learning a high number of chords is the main barrier for adoption, as in other application areas. Based on that, we discuss ideas on how chorded keyboards with a strongly reduced alphabet, hand gestures, and voice recognition might be used as a viable, multi-modal support for authoring situated visualizations in-situ.",

Targeting at chemistry education, our goal is to make virtual molecule structures more tangible. Results of an initial user study indicate that the VR molecular construction kit was positively received. Compared to a physical construction kit, the VR molecular construction kit is on the same level in terms of natural interaction. Besides, it fosters the typical digital advantages though, such as saving, exporting, and sharing of molecules. Feedback from the study participants has also revealed potential future avenues for tangible molecule visualizations.",

In this paper, a visual representation in combination with cluster analysis is presented to give the planners support in geospatial shaping. These methods allow to identify commonalities in municipalities and reveal potential options for a geospatial development. For this purpose, public data for eight municipalities are gathered from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and Open Street Map. Our results give clear commonalities for each municipality and allow to determine the places which have more development resources.",

The application of topic models results in concepts, the so-called topics, and a high-dimensional description of the documents. For visualization tasks, they can be projected onto a lower-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction techniques. Though the quality of the resulting point layout mainly depends on the chosen topic model and dimensionality reduction technique, it is unclear which particular combinations are suitable for displaying the semantic relatedness between the documents. In this work, we propose a benchmark comprising various datasets, layout algorithms and their hyperparameters, and quality metrics for conducting an empirical study.",

    "abstract": "In 2021, the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons (FHGR) set the world record for the most accurate calculation of the circular number pi by calculating 62.8 trillion decimal places. The goal of the follow-up project described here is to present the world record to the public using different methodologies. To make the record comprehensible, it was planned to use different techniques and methods to convey the dimensions of the calculated number. In a first step, we created a website to allow searching for number patterns within the decimal places of pi. So far, pattern search has been implemented for dates, birthdays, and geocoordinates. We developed a custom corporate design and implemented it into the website for its presentation. We also enriched data with Linked Open Data. Further implementations, for example in the form of a virtual reality experience in the “Igloo” at the Institute for Multimedia Production at FHGR, are planned.",

One key approach is to show the impact of a feature on the model prediction. This helps experts to verify and validate the predictions the model provides. However, many challenges remain open. For example, due to the subjective nature of interpretability, a strict definition of concepts such as the contribution of a feature remains elusive. Different techniques have varying underlying assumptions, which can cause inconsistent and conflicting views. In this work, we introduce Local and Global Contribution-Value plots as a novel approach to visualize feature impact on predictions and the relationship with feature value.

    "abstract": "One of the major problems of applying supervised machine learning methods in real-world problems is the absence of labeled data. Labeling huge amounts of data is time consuming and cost intensive. Moreover, in many cases, labels can only be assigned by domain experts like medical doctors or engineers, who have little time and do not necessarily have profound machine learning knowledge. In this paper, we propose an efficient interactive cluster-clean-label approach. First, to visualize the potentially huge amount of data, principal component analysis followed by t-SNE projection is applied. On the 2-dimensional representation of the data, HDBSCAN clustering is utilized to identify groups of potentially similar class membership. Subsequently, anomaly detection in form of an autoencoder is applied on each cluster, and instances that are likely to belong to different classes are suggested to the user. The user decides which of these suggested instances to include and restarts the anomaly detection process with the remaining subset of instances. This iterative process is repeated until the user is satisfied with the clusters' purity. Eventually, labels are assigned to the clusters. The approach is evaluated by a user study with 25 participants using the initially unlabeled MNIST data set, where on average users were able to label 91.59% of the data set, with an accuracy of 98.99%.

With model-based active learning and user-based interactive labeling, there are two complementary strategies for this task. We present an approach that combines the strengths of both areas and aims to guide users through model-based recommendations and highlighting in one interface when selecting and labeling instances. For this purpose, an active learning strategy is used to recommend useful instances in addition to the user-based selection of instances. We have implemented the approach and conducted a user survey to research the effects guidance by visual cues has on the users' selection strategies. The proposed approach combines both perspectives in a single interactive visualization to support the user with different degrees of guidance in the selection of instances. Our results of the user survey suggest that user guidance has a positive influence on the users' perceived confidence and difficulty in selecting instances, on their orientation, and on their perceived impression of the models' performance.

    "abstract": "In this paper an overview-based interactive visualization for temporally long dynamic graph sequences is described. To reach this goal, each graph can be mapped to a certain value based on a given property. Among others, a property can be number of vertices, number of edges, average degree, density, number of self-loops, degree (maximum and total), or edge weight (minimum, maximum, and total). To achieve an overview over time, an aggregation strategy based on either the mean, minimum, or maximum of two values is applied. This temporal value aggregation generates a triangular shape with an overview of the entire graph sequence as the peak. The color coding can be adjusted, forming visual patterns that can be rapidly explored for certain data features over time, supporting comparison tasks between the properties. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by means of applying it to dynamic graphs generated from US domestic flight data.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new visualization of family relations, called family metro map, which is inspired by the famous London Underground Map. A family is represented by a metro line, where the parents are the end nodes and the children the intermediate nodes. We introduce family trees as rooted binary trees and consider the problem of automatically drawing a family metro map for a given family tree without crossing line segments, where the successive nodes of a metro line are placed at equal distances. The inter-node distance may be chosen to depend on the generation of the family, such that metro lines of earlier generations are shown more prominently than metro lines of later generations.",

To reach our goal we apply node-link diagrams, word clouds, heatmaps, and area plots to the preprocessed and transformed DBLP data. All visualizations are equipped with interaction techniques and are built by using the functionality of the Bokeh library in Python, which enables the users to run the eDBLP in a web browser and to explore the dataset in an interactive and intuitive way. Finally, we discuss limitations and scalability issues of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate product placement significantly influences how viewers easily find their favorites, especially when they try to select products from digital signage displays. This increases the demand for dynamic categorization and optimal placement of items according to the context in which viewers explore their preferred choices. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing the placement of items by respecting the underlying context in the search for favorites. Our approach starts with formulating the static placement of items as a constrained optimization problem, in which we incorporate design rules that highlight the underlying categorization of the items. We then extend this idea to accommodate dynamic placement according to the context in which users explore their preferred choices. This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the priority of each item based on the distribution of visual attention obtained by an eye-tracking device. In particular, we construct a context map for understanding the relationship between the items by taking advantage of topic-based text mining techniques. We provide several examples of gaze-based interaction to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach, which is followed by a discussion on possible directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Public transport maps are typically designed in a way to support route finding tasks for passengers while they also provide an overview about stations, metro lines, and city-specific attractions. Most of those maps are designed as a static representation, maybe placed in a metro station or printed in a travel guide. In this paper we describe a dynamic, interactive public transport map visualization enhanced by additional views for the dynamic passenger data on different levels of temporal granularity. Moreover, we also allow extra statistical information in form of density plots, calendar-based visualizations, and line graphs. All this information is linked to the contextual metro map to give a viewer insights into the relations between time points and typical routes taken by the passengers. We illustrate the usefulness of our interactive visualization by applying it to the railway system of Hamburg in Germany while also taking into account the extra passenger data. As another indication for the usefulness of the interactively enhanced metro maps we conducted a user experiment with 20 participants.",

    "abstract": "In visualization, user guidance has become an essential concept to aid users in making informed decisions ranging from what subsets to focus on in the data space to which regions to explore in the view space. To guide users, predominantly visual cues like colors or arrows are used to indicate particular targets or directions. In this paper, we explore the possibility of another sensory channel for guidance cues: vibrotactile feedback. To that end, we explore different properties of the vibrotactile channel (e.g., amplitude and duration) and discuss their potential use as guidance cues. We then report on an experiment (N=14) in which we investigate possible vibrotactile cues in comparison to visual cues and to a combination of visual and vibrotactile cues for a guided selection scenario and a guided navigation scenario. Although none of the vibrotactile cues significantly outperformed the visual cues, our study results shed light on a number of practical issues when using vibration for user guidance - including differences between various types of vibrotactile feedback, as well as diverging performance for different guidance scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Human-centered machine learning is becoming an emerging field aiming to enable domain experts that do not necessarily have a data science background to make use of machine learning applications. Especially in unsupervised machine learning, e.g. cluster analysis, models cannot be autonomously tuned towards an optimal solution for a given application due to the absence of ground truth like class labels. In cluster analysis, different feature subsets may lead to different clusterings. The identification of the best subset of given features is therefore essential in order to improve the overall clustering performance and to obtain a clustering that is suitable for a given application. To support users in finding an optimal clustering solution, we propose XplainableClusterExplorer, an interactive and explorative approach suitable for feature selection for clustering. In an interactive combination of user and machine learning models, the user is supported by evaluation criteria and visualizations in determining feature subsets and adjusting hyperparameters. For feature subset selection we propose a combination with feature importances from random forests and LIME. Since this requires a supervised setting, the cluster assignments are used as tentative class labels in subsequent step. Our experimental results have shown that this subsequent classification step leveraging calculated feature importances can facilitate feature subset selection and therefore enhance overall clustering performance.",

In addition, several methods for pruning the spatial point cloud are introduced. These pruning methods can significantly reduce the computation time needed for the transformation. A Voronoi diagram can be constructed from the pruned spatial point cloud using either a naive approach or a Delaunay triangulation. Moreover, an order-k Voronoi diagram can be constructed using this naive approach. We introduce many configuration parameters and we integrate interactivity in the Voronoi diagram by giving users the ability to manually add and remove centroids. To make the application accessible to everyone, we provide a web-based solution by using the Vue.js framework based on the JavaScript programming language. This solution supports the transformation from an image to a Voronoi diagram in a browser, and hence, has the advantage of not being restricted to a certain kind of environment. We illustrate the usefulness of our application by applying it to several images.",

    "abstract": "Data visualization blends art and science to convey stories from data via graphical representations. Considering different problems, applications, requirements, and design goals, it is challenging to combine these two components at their full force. While the art component involves creating visually appealing and easily interpreted graphics for users, the science component requires accurate representations of a large amount of input data. With a lack of the science component, visualization cannot serve its role of creating correct representations of the actual data, thus leading to wrong perception, interpretation, and decision. It might be even worse if incorrect visual representations were intentionally produced to deceive the viewers. This work-in-progress paper focuses on misinformation in graphical representations utilizing a case-based learning approach. The misleading data visualization examples are surveyed and projected onto fundamental units of visual communication, such as size, value, shape, size, and position. This work aims at helping viewers understand the root causes of the misuse, as well as provide basic principles for making more effective visualizations.",

Our technique allows the user to visually inspect how hidden states store and process information throughout the feeding of an input sequence into the network. It can answer questions such as which parts of the input data had a higher impact on the prediction and how the model correlates each hidden state configuration with a certain output. Our visualization comprises several components: our input visualization shows the input sequence and how it relates to the output (using color coding); hidden states are visualized by nonlinear projection to 2-D visualization space via t-SNE in order to understand the shape of the space of hidden states; time curves are employed to show the details of the evolution of hidden state configurations; and a time-multi-class heatmap matrix visualizes the evolution of expected predictions for multi-class classifiers. To demonstrate the capability of our approach, we discuss two typical use cases for long short-term memory (LSTM) models applied to two widely used natural language processing (NLP) datasets.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a 2.5D visualization technique based on the dust & magnet metaphor, which generally allows for interactively exploring and analyzing large multivariate data sets. In addition to position and color, we introduce height as additional visual variable for particles to encode extra data attributes in the 2.5D visualization, thus increasing the potential for identifying correlations between attributes. Further, we have developed a real-time collision detection algorithm as part of the particle simulation that ensures overlap-free particle positioning, thereby enabling the continuous perception of patterns, clusters, and outliers. These extensions facilitate on-the-fly validation of hypotheses through the highly dynamic configuration of magnets and visual attribute encoding, which also allows for a better integration of the user's domain knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays video plays an important role in the coaching of athletes across many different sports. For sailing training sessions, the videos are recorded from the coach boat and provide ways to review and analyze the training sessions aiming at improving the sailors performance. On one hand, videos are commonly recorded with handheld devices that are rather cumbersome to acquire and are prone to missing many important moments. On the other hand, recordings of entire sessions with an integrated camera in the coach boat are difficult to analyze given their length and the lack of image stability. We present a pipeline to facilitate the visual analysis of these full session videos. We extract manoeuvres as interesting segments, and provide a visualization framework to present the video and processed data. Manoeuvres are extracted by detecting and tracking the boat and sailors. With the visualization tool, the user can locate and visually inspect those manoeuvres for coaching tasks. We evaluated the potential of the framework and from the results we conclude that the manoeuvre detection is reasonably accurate and some coaches see potential in the presented framework.",

We provide the option to view the same dataset from multiple coordinated perspectives, thus providing the possibility to gain more analytical insight than if the dataset was visualized in a single view. We focus on several hierarchy visualization techniques which can be either in 2D, 3D, or a virtual reality environment. The choice of programming language is JavaScript, with the aid of PixiJS and Three.js libraries. We demonstrate the usefulness of our tool by applying it to the NCBI taxonomy, a hierarchically structured dataset which contains over 300,000 elements.",

The amount of the generated text explodes with the increase of items and attributes. This study addresses this problem for table data, whose attributes and data items are hierarchically organized. In our approach, the user's point of view is modeled by the dual focalization axis, which consists of the attribute-based and the data-item-based focal points. The user can refine the two-dimensional focal points to obtain the chart and the text that explain the data facts found in a more focused portion of the dataset.

    "abstract": "Visualizing graphs is a challenging task due to the various properties of the underlying relational data. For sparse and small graphs the perceptually most efficient way are node-link diagrams whereas for dense graphs with attached data, adjacency matrices might be the better choice. Since graphs can contain both properties, being globally sparse and locally dense, a combination of several visualizations is beneficial. In this paper we describe a visually and algorithmically scalable approach to provide views and perspectives about graphs as interactively linked node-link as well as adjacency matrix visualizations. The novelty of the technique is that insights like clusters or anomalies from one or several combined views can be used to influence the layout or reordering of the others. Moreover, the importance of nodes and node groups can be detected, computed, and visualized by taking into account several layout and reordering properties in combination as well as different edge properties for the same set of nodes. We illustrate the usefulness of our tool by applying it to graph datasets like co-authorships, co-citations, and a CPAN distribution.",

Alongside the rapid geographical development and constantly rising number of confirmed cases, mixed spread of information and disinformation also plagued the public with distress, fear, and anxiety, transmitting a negative sentiment across many groups. Facing this, we experiment with the aesthetics of visualizations in educating laymen about positive facts during the pandemic. By blending artistic expressions into the visual encoding, we intend to tell a compelling data story describing the international scientific dedication in fighting the disease collaboratively. We present the visualization to collect feedback and evaluate the expected functions from general audience instead of traditional expert user groups.",

We have built a web-based application that contains various visual techniques to display the temporal data sets by SPLOM at each snapshot and animate the SPLOM to illustrate the evolution of the data sets.

However, it is better to provide some guidance so that the users can quickly locate the \"interesting\" or \"informative\" area in the graph. Then they can start the next stage of sense-making. We propose a visual exploration system which provides some frequent sub-graphs extracted from the whole graph, and the relationship between them. Thus, users can raise their study questions more quickly when they first confront a graph dataset. We evaluate our exploration system with two datasets. Specifically, we demonstrate how to raise a question and find the answer with our system, which validates the effectiveness of this project.",

The dimension time is of great interest to analysts as it offers insights into various trends and patterns such as changing relationships between different actors or economic opportunities for businesses. Yet current approaches suffer from limitations that can be improved with the visualization design presented in this work. The visualization was developed considering aesthetic criteria and characteristics of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams. In a formative evaluation process an artificial dataset was specifically created to examine dynamic social networks. A qualitative user study with observation and think-aloud protocols was conducted and analyzed with regard to the user's strategies, limitations of the visualization and potential additional features. The visualization appears to be suitable for all of the evaluated network tasks, however, path-related tasks were more challenging similar to the characteristics of matrix-based representations.",

There are three problems in its application of the traffic state discrimination: First, the existing traffic state discrimination model is only for road segment detection; Second, the road-segment based discrimination model is not conducive to the spatial-temporal evolution analysis of traffic state. Third, the existing road segment traffic state discrimination model directly adopts the prototypical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, and the detection result is limited in accuracy. We proposed a multi-dimensional traffic state discrimination method. Firstly, the traffic state of the road segment is determined based on the improved DBSCAN algorithm. The dynamic segmentation technology is used to realize the visualization of the road traffic state. Then, the traffic incident point discrimination model is constructed according to the spatial-temporal evolution pattern of the road conditions under traffic incidents. The visualization results show that the proposed method can achieve relatively fine multidimensional traffic state discrimination.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of several techniques to visualize and analyze eye movement data tracked and recorded from public transport map viewers in a formerly conducted eye tracking experiment. Such techniques include heat maps and gaze stripes. To overcome the disadvantages and improve the effectiveness of those techniques, we present a viable solution that makes use of existing techniques such as heat maps and gaze stripes, as well as attention clouds which are inspired by the general concept of word clouds. We also develop a web application with interactive attention clouds, named the EyeCloud, to put theory into practice. The main objective of this paper is to help public transport map designers and producers gain feedback and insights on how the current design of the map can be further improved, by leveraging on the visualization tool. In addition, this visualization tool, the EyeCloud, can be easily extended to many other purposes with various types of data. It could be possibly applied to entertainment industries, for instance, to track the attention of the film audiences in order to improve the advertisements.",

These datasets require applications that are capable of handling them whilst providing an environment that enables the analyst(s) to focus on the task of analysing the movement in the context of the geographic environment it occurred in. We present a framework for collaborative analysis of geospatial-temporal movement data with a use-case in collective behavior analysis. It supports the concurrent usage of several program instances, allowing to have different perspectives on the same data in collocated or remote setups. The implementation can be deployed in a variety of immersive environments, e.g. on a tiled display wall or mobile VR devices.",

    "abstract": "When frogmen perform underwater tasks, the visibility and permeability of the surrounding environment are poor due to the influence of slit, sewage and sediment, and the visual distance is only about 3-5 meters. However, integrating multi-beam imaging sonar on the top of frogman's helmet and displaying real-time sonar image information through AR glasses can expand frogman's \"field of view\" to 100 meters. This system satisfies the big view field of target monitoring and searching and the small view field of target recognition and tracking, thus greatly improving frogman's underwater situational awareness ability. Helmet display system, as a typical application of AR technology, has been widely used in F35 fighter plane and BMW motorcycle. However, due to the limited display area, low underwater visibility and difficult interaction, there is no helmet display system suitable for underwater Frogman. To this end, we design and implement a monocular silicon-based perspective VR visualization system for underwater frogman, which breaks through a series of key technologies that sonar, camera and underwater environment information multi-source data fusion, multi-window adaptive layout technology, sonar image real-time visualization technology and camera image real-time visualization technology, and realizes multi-source information integration and VR panoramic visualization for underwater frogman operation.",

This paper systematically introduces and classifies software maps as a treemap-based technique for software cartography. It provides an overview of advanced visual metaphors and techniques, each suitable for interactive visual analytics tasks, that can be used to enhance the expressiveness of software maps. Thereto, the metaphors and techniques are briefly described, located within a visualization pipeline model, and considered within the software map design space. Consequent applications and use cases w.r.t. different types of software system data and software engineering data are discussed, arguing for a versatile use of software maps in visual software analytics.",

    "abstract": "Many visual analytics have been developed for examining scientific publications comprising wealthy data such as authors and citations. The studies provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, e.g., literature review and collaboration analysis. However, visual information (i.e., figures) that are widely employed for storytelling and methods description are often neglected. We present VIStory, an interactive storyboard for exploring visual information in scientific publications. We harvest the data using an automatic figure extraction method, resulting in a large corpora of figures. Each figure contains various attributes such as dominant color and width/height ratio, together with faceted metadata of the publication including venues, authors, and keywords. To depict these information, we develop an intuitive interface consisting of three components: 1) Faceted View enables efficient query by publication metadata, benefiting from a nested table structure, 2) Storyboard View arranges paper rings -- a well-designed glyph for depicting figure attributes, in a themeriver layout to reveal temporal trends, and 3) Endgame View presents a highlighted figure together with the publication metadata. The system is especially useful for scientific publications containing substantial visual information, such as the visualization publications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using two case studies conducted on past ten-year IEEE VIS publications in 2009 - 2018.",

One of the most important features is the font size, which represents words frequencies of a document. As the result, in this paper, we explore how to set font sizes of words, and its influence on semantic understanding through people's performance with qualitative and controlled experiments. Adopting an machine learning algorithm LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model, we quantify semantics of the document and judge participants' accuracy performance. The experimental results show the influence of different font size on semantic understanding performance and provide insights for ways in promoting semantic understanding of word cloud.",

    "abstract": "Historical texts form the basis of the study of antiquities. In the case of Chinese historical texts different genres exist, e.g. chronological and biographical works etc. The contents of these texts normally consist of complex and interrelated information which covers long time period. Traditional history research relies heavily on information extraction and analysis by human researchers. With the recent development of the internet, data science and visualization technologies, digital history gradually attracts more and more attentions and in turn significantly impacts the field of historical study through altering the accessibility of the source materials, the narrative strategy and the analytical methodologies. This paper provides a system that enhances the Chinese historical research using word segmentation, texts analysis and visualization technologies. We can improve the workflow of traditional historical research via automatically detecting important keywords in Chinese historical texts and extracting, analyzing and visualizing the relations between a keyword and other words. This does not only accelerate the text based historical study but also to a great extent increase the scope of the search and analysis of the keywords in Chinese historical texts which used to be limited by the capacity of human researchers.",

In addition, we build an interactive visual analysis system with a user-friendly interface for an interactive visual query about complex business and environment information. Our system can help users select retailing store location, support interactive visual queries, and display rich information to facilitate manager in decision-making.",

Analysis of the collected data supports research on animal behaviour, influence of impact factors such as climate change and human intervention, as well as conservation programs. Analysis of the movement data is difficult, due to the nature of the research questions and the complexity of the data sets. It requires both automated analysis, e.g. for the detection of behavioural patterns, and human inspection, e.g. for interpretation, inclusion of previous knowledge, and for conclusions on future actions and decision making. We present a concept and implementation for the visual analysis of cheetah movement data in a web-based fashion that allows usage both in the field and in office environments.",

Moreover, designing a visualization course, matching the different experiences and skills of the students is one major goal in order to find a common solvable task for all of the students. However, the given task is important to follow a common goal, to collaborate in small project groups, but also to further experience, learn, or extend programming skills. In this paper we describe an approach to manage a large number of 272 students in a design-based active learning course who were relatively unexperienced first year bachelor students with a wide range of programming skills. We explain different subsequent stages to successfully handle the upcoming problems and describe how many and to which extent supervisors are involved in the development of the project. The project task description is given in a way that it has a minimal number of requirements but can be extended in many directions while most of the decisions are up to the students like programming languages, visualization approaches, or interaction techniques. Finally, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of our teaching strategy.",

The basic idea of our method is first to approximate normals of object surfaces by interpolating normals assigned to vertices of triangles obtained by triangulating the object region, and then deform textures inside the object region by offsetting texture coordinates with amount determined by empirical functions applied to normals. The final appearance of inflated objects is suggested by both shading calculated by use of approximated normals and deformed textures over the object region. The experimental results demonstrate that our triangle based normal interpolation approach is able to better approximate the object surface than the previous object boundary based normal interpolation did, thus, the inflation process can be speeded up significantly due to reduction in number of iterations required for obtaining a smooth inflated surface.",

In recent years, machine learning has seen great advances. Increasing processing power and growth in data as well as affordable storage have led to more advanced algorithms. Therefore, with the emergence of applicable machine learning algorithms, there is now a method for preserving and making use even of complex knowledge. In this paper, we present a concept that allows to extract and utilize domain knowledge for exploratory data analysis. We introduce concepts of interaction store and analysis context store to record user interaction and context during an exploratory analysis. We use the recorded data to construct semantic interaction sequences and predict their potential insight. The prediction can then be used to guide other data scientist in their sensemaking while performing exploratory data analysis in similar domains and use cases. Furthermore, we discuss possible research opportunities and implications resulting from the presented concept.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical knots are different from everyday ropes in that they are infinitely stretchy and flexible when being deformed into their ambient isotopic. For this reason, a number of challenges arise when visualizing mathematical knot's static and changing structures during topological deformation. In this paper we focus on computational methods to visually communicate the mathematical knot's dynamics by computationally simulating the topological deformation and capturing the critical changes during the entire simulation. To further improve our visual experience, we propose a fast and adaptive method to extract key moments where only critical changes occur to represent and summarize the long deformation sequence. We conduct evaluation study to showcase the efficacy and efficiency of our methods.",

    "abstract": "Transportation networks are important components of digital maps. The display of streets and railroad lines are a key for orientation and navigation using traditional and digital maps. While 2D digital maps enable effective communication, their visualization within 3D digital maps, based on virtual 3D city models, is often subject to occlusion that hinders the effective perception. There are a number of approaches to partially resolve occlusion effects within 3D geovirtual environments such as ghosted and cut-away views as well as interactive multi-perspective views are often applied. This paper proposes occlusion hints to emphasize occluded parts of transportation networks. In contrast to existing occlusion management techniques, these present only hints towards occluded parts to the viewer.",

Information-theoretic streamline distribution method performs well on demonstrating feature regions but only considers the direction component of vector. Our algorithm places streamlines based on information entropy calculated by both vector direction and vector magnitude, to cover more information of the flow field. By considering vector magnitude, the initial streamlines derived from entropy and supplementary streamlines derived from conditional entropy can convey the steepness of speed variation. An advanced streamline pruning method is also applied to improve the efficiency of our algorithm. Results prove that the streamlines produced by our algorithm can reflect the vector magnitude variation of a flow field without losing sight of the salient features.",

In this paper, we provide a smooth feature flow animation for planar domains. Feature flow behaviors are clearly shown through smooth animation achieved by configuring critical points and constructing spatio-temporal coherent patterns. Critical points can be seeded at any position in the flow domain. We partition the flow space into regions with Voronoi tessellation and construct the flow pattern in each region. When one critical point moves, we add the original vector field to the dynamic vector field, optimize the vector values at the boundary, and update flow patterns over time. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively address texture aliasing or distortion in feature flow animation.",

First of all, according to the characteristics of cartography, the cartographic rules contained in each cartographic link were summarized, and then the dynamic map template applied to the whole cartographic process was designed by using cartographic rules as the basic unit, and finally through converting the user's cartographic operations into the cartographic rules and the organic combination of cartographic rules, a dynamic map template was constructed. Compared with the traditional map template, the dynamic map template has strong hierarchical and scalability, which helps to simplify the cartographic process and ensure the scientificity of the user's actions.",

Firstly, based on the extracted skeletons of a non-rigid shape and geodesic distance computation, the center point in skeleton is defined and detected. Then, a skeleton tree is constructed based on the connection between the center point and other discrete points in skeleton. After that, a correspondence between the skeleton tree and the area distribution of the non-rigid shape is established. The skeleton tree features are achieved. The advantages of our method can be summarized as follows: (1) Scale-Invariant; (2) Low computational complexity; (3) Automatic topology repair. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by its high performance in image-based medical analysis, this poster paper explores the use of advanced segmentation techniques for industrial Microwave Tomography (MWT). Our context is the visual analysis of moisture levels in porous foams undergoing microwave drying. We propose an automatic segmentation technique---MWT Segmentation based on K-means (MWTS-KM) and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy for industrial use. MWTS-KM consists of three stages: image augmentation, grey-scale conversion, and K-means implementation. To estimate the performance of this technique, we empirically benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against two well-established alternatives: Otsu and K-means. To elicit performance data, three metrics (Jaccard index, Dice coefficient and false positive) are used. Based on our experiments, our results indicate that MWTS-KM outperforms the well-established Otsu and K-means.",

Parsing has been a fundamental issue in the research of context-sensitive graph grammars. However, the existent parsing algorithms are either inefficient or confined to a minority of graph grammars. This paper presents two strategies for general parsing algorithms, one is context matching, and the other is partitioning of productions. Through narrowing down the searching space of potential redexex, the two strategies can considerably improve the parsing performance.",

    "abstract": "In online dynamic graph drawing, constraints over nodes and node pairs help preserve a coherent mental map in a sequence of graphs. Defining the constraints is challenging due to the requirements of both preserving mental map and satisfying the visual aesthetics of a graph layout. Most existing algorithms basically depend on local changes but fail to do proper evaluations on the global propagation when setting constraints. To solve this problem, we introduce a heuristic model derived from PageRank which simulates the node movement as an inverse Markov process hence to give a global analysis of the layout's change, according to which different constraints can be set. These constraints, along with stress function, generate layouts maintaining spatial positions and shapes of relatively stable substructures between adjacent graphs. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves both structure and position similarity to help users track graph changes visually.",

An edge sampling method based on accept-reject random sampling is designed for visualizing dynamic network via MSV. The method is able to improve the overall readability of MSV while preserving time varying network behaviors. It is also a preliminary attempt to apply graph-sampling technique into dynamic network analysis.",

Art and cultural heritage represent a repository of highly condensed information that through digital transformation can be extracted from a single object to create a new set of products that multiply the original possibilities in other unimagined forms. This is a process of technique, and a process of art as well. This paper mainly introduces two research projects hosted by JALAB last year, which were related to \"glaze crack pattern\" and \"Vortex Pattern\" from art heritage in Shanghai Museum. The purpose is not to discover new theory or invent new technology, but to apply existing digital techniques to find morphological rules in cultural symbols and to create easy-to-use design tools, so that with the help of which people have no background in mathematics or design skills can also create things that are not only derived from traditional culture but also have a sense of contemporary.",

What's more, the hardware requirements are also higher than before, resulting in a larger detection cost. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an improved CNN model based on YOLO model, darknet 53 construction. By introducing batch normalization and RPN networks and improving the network structure for traffic sign detection tasks, the YOLO neural network detection model is optimized. The accuracy of the model in the traffic sign detection task is greatly improved, and the detection speed becomes faster. The results show that the method in this paper is of great help to improve the accuracy and detection speed of traffic sign detection and reduce the hardware requirements of the detection system as well.",

    "abstract": "Wood defect will reduce wood properties, wood quality and use value, so it is of great practical significance to detect wood defect[1]. The key to feature extraction of target defect image is target recognition and classification. Moment feature is a common feature descriptor in defect extraction algorithm. Aiming at the problem that the seven feature components of Hu moments differ greatly in magnitude and are affected by scale factor, based on the principle and characteristics of invariant moments and wavelet energy, a feature extraction algorithm based on wavelet moments is proposed and applied to the feature extraction of wood defects. Finally, the experiment collects the actual wood defect image, decomposes the preprocessed image into three sub-images by wavelet transform, calculates the modified Hu moment invariants for the sub-images, takes the moment invariants as the feature variables, and obtains the recognition results by using the minimum neighborhood distance classification. The experimental results show that the feature extracted by this method has the invariance of translation, rotation and scale, and can reflect the important and original attributes of the target image. Compared with the traditional Hu moment, the recognition rate is significantly improved, and the expected goal is achieved.",
